  "review": "\"This Hotel Is Haunted!\" is a delightful addition to the Geronimo Stilton series, offering a perfect blend of mystery and humor that keeps young readers engaged. The story of Geronimo and Hercule Poirat investigating the spooky Grand Hotel is both entertaining and cleverly written. It's a fun read that I would recommend to anyone looking for a light, engaging children's book."
