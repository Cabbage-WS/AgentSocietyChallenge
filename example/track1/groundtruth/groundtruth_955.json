    "review": "I had a positive experience at Public Storage. The staff, particularly Monika, was friendly and efficient, making the process of renting a unit smooth and hassle-free. The facility is clean and secure, which gave me peace of mind. While I haven't faced any issues with pricing so far, I hope they remain consistent to avoid the problems mentioned by other reviewers. Overall, it's a good option for storage needs."
