    "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Triple Bottom Brewing. The atmosphere is bright and inviting, and the beer selection was solid, though not exceptional. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, which made the visit enjoyable. I appreciate the brewery's mission and would definitely return to try more of their offerings."
