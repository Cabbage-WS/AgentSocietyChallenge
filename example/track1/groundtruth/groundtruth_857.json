  "review": "Frank's Breakfast & Lunch is a hidden gem with a nostalgic diner vibe. The food is solid, especially the home fries and scrapple, which were cooked to perfection. The service is friendly, and the place has a no-frills, authentic feel that I really enjoyed. It's a great spot for a quick, satisfying breakfast."
