    "review": "Bindi offers a unique twist on Indian cuisine, but it didn't fully meet my expectations. The food was flavorful, but some dishes felt overly greasy and lacked the authenticity I was hoping for. The BYO concept is fun, but the cash-only policy and tight seating made the experience less enjoyable. I might give it another try, but it's not my go-to Indian spot."
