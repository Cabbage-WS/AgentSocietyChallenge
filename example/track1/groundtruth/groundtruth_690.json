    "review": "I visited Charley's American Bar & Restaurant for the first time and had mixed feelings. The atmosphere was lively, and the karaoke setup was fun, but the food was just average. The service was decent, but I expected more from the menu based on the reviews. It's a good spot for drinks and entertainment, but I wouldn't rush back for the food."
