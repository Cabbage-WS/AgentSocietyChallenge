    "review": "I had a great experience at Perdigon El Sabor! The food was flavorful and authentic, especially the arepas and cachapas, which were delicious. The service was a bit slow, but the cozy atmosphere and fresh ingredients made up for it. Definitely worth a visit for anyone craving Venezuelan cuisine."
