    "review": "I had a decent experience at QDOBA Mexican Eats. The food was filling and the staff was friendly, but it didn't blow me away. The flavors were a bit bland, and the overall experience felt like a typical fast-food chain. I might come back if I'm in a hurry, but there are better options for Mexican food in the area."
