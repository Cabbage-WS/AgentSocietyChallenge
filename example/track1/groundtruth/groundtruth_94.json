    "review": "I visited Lucky 7 Tavern on a quiet weekday evening, hoping for a relaxed dining experience. The food was decent, with the fish tacos being a highlight, but the service was a bit slow and inattentive. While the atmosphere was casual and the prices reasonable, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Overall, it's a solid neighborhood spot, but there's room for improvement."
