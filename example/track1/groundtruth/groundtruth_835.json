    "review": "I had high hopes for 12th Street Cantina after hearing mixed reviews, but my experience was just average. The chicken mole burrito was decent, but it lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting. The staff was friendly, but the overall experience didn't stand out. It's a good option for a quick bite in Reading Terminal Market, but there are better Mexican spots in the area."
