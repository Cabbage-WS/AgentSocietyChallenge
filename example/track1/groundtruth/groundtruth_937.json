    "review": "Nico's Mexican Food is a solid spot for quick, affordable Mexican food. The carne asada burrito I had was flavorful and filling, though the portion size could be a bit inconsistent based on other reviews. The staff was friendly, and the drive-thru service was fast, which is always a plus. I'd recommend it for a casual meal, especially if you're in a hurry."
