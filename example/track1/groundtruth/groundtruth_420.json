    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Feretti Motors. They promised me a car in perfect condition, but when I received it, it was far from that. The interior was dirty, the exterior had scratches, and the car had mechanical issues right after I drove it off. I feel completely misled and disappointed. Buyer beware!"
