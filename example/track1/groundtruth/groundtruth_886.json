    "review": "This Starbucks is conveniently located in Old City, but it can get quite crowded, especially during tourist season. The staff is generally friendly, but the service can be slow at times. The seating is limited, which makes it difficult to relax and enjoy your drink. Overall, it's an average Starbucks experience."
