    "review": "I had a delightful experience at Rita's Italian Ice! The variety of water ice flavors is impressive, and I particularly enjoyed the combination of cherry and chocolate. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming. While the prices are a bit steep, the quality of the treats makes it worth it for a special treat."
