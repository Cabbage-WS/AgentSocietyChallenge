    "review": "I decided to try Palazzo Pizza after hearing so much buzz about it in the neighborhood. The pizza was delicious, with a perfect crust and high-quality ingredients. The staff was friendly, and the outdoor seating was a nice touch. While it wasn't the absolute best pizza I've ever had, it's definitely a solid option for a casual meal. I'll be back to try more of their menu."
