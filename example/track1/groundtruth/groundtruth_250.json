    "review": "Pho Don exceeded my expectations with its authentic Vietnamese flavors and friendly service. The pho was rich and flavorful, and the grilled pork vermicelli was perfectly balanced. The staff were attentive and made the experience even better. I'll definitely be coming back for more!"
