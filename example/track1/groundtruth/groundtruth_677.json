    "review": "I had high hopes for Kingdom of Vegetarians, but the experience was a bit underwhelming. The food was decent, but not as flavorful as I expected. The service was friendly, but the ambiance felt a bit outdated. I might give it another try, but there are better vegetarian options nearby."
