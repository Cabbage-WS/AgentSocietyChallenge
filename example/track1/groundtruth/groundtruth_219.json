    "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Fresh N Fun! The food was fresh and flavorful, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I tried the shrimp gyro and the fried tilapia sandwich, both of which were delicious and well-prepared. While the drive-thru wait was a bit long, it was worth it for the quality of the food. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!"
