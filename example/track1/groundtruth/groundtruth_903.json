    "review": "The Hyde Out offers a unique blend of a trendy bar and a casual restaurant. The sushi was fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere was lively and fun. However, the service could be a bit slow at times, which slightly dampened the experience. Overall, it's a great spot for a night out with friends."
