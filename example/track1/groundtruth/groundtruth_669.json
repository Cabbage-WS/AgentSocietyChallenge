    "review": "Coco's Cookies & Creamery is a solid spot for dessert lovers. The gelati and soft serve were both delicious, and the delivery was impressively well-packaged. However, the prices are a bit steep for some items, which might deter me from frequent visits. Overall, it's a great place for a treat, but not an everyday indulgence."
