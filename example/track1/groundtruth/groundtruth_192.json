    "review": "I had a decent experience at Laid Pretty Boutique. The staff was friendly, and the salon had a welcoming atmosphere. My stylist, Jade, did a good job with my hair, and I appreciated the plant-based products used. However, the prices felt a bit steep, and the appointment booking process could be more transparent. Overall, it was a positive visit, but there's room for improvement."
