  "review": "I had high hopes for El Soto Deli & Grocery after hearing so many positive reviews, but my experience was disappointing. The staff was unfriendly, and the sandwich I ordered was poorly made\u2014the bread was stale, and the ingredients were sparse. This place doesn't live up to the hype, and I won't be returning."
