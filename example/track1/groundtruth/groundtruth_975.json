  "review": "I visited Cosi for a quick lunch and found the food to be decent, though not exceptional. The flatbread sandwiches were tasty, but the service was a bit slow, which was frustrating during a busy workday. The prices felt a little high for the quality, but it\u2019s a convenient option for a quick bite in the area."
