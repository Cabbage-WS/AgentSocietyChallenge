    "review": "I had an incredible experience at 4th Avenue Hair! Andrea was absolutely fantastic—she took her time to understand my hair needs and delivered a cut and color that exceeded my expectations. The shampoo massage was pure bliss, and the atmosphere was so relaxing. I’ll definitely be coming back!"
