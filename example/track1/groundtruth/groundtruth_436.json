    "review": "I had high expectations for Gaeta's Italian Bakery based on the rave reviews, but my experience was just average. The tomato pie was decent, but the crust was a bit too thick for my taste, and the sauce lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for. While it wasn't bad, it didn't live up to the hype. I might try it again, but I've definitely had better tomato pies elsewhere."
