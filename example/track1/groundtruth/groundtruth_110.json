    "review": "I had high hopes for Golden Dragon, but the experience was underwhelming. The food was decent, but lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting. The service was friendly, but the overall atmosphere felt drab. It's a decent option if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
