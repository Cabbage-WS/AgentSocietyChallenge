  "review": "I bought this UV curing light for my SLA 3D printing projects and it has been quite effective. The 6W power with a 60W effect is impressive and cures resin efficiently, though I had to be cautious with the UV exposure. It\u2019s a solid tool for the price, but the lack of a built-in timer could be a minor inconvenience for some users."
