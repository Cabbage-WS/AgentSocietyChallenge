    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Catalina Cleaners. The staff was unhelpful and the prices were exorbitant. I brought in a few items for dry cleaning and was shocked when I was charged nearly $50 for basic services. The quality of the cleaning was also subparâ€”my clothes came back with noticeable stains. I will not be returning and would strongly advise others to avoid this place."
