    "review": "Mustard Greens offers a refreshing take on Chinese cuisine with its fresh, non-greasy dishes and pleasant atmosphere. The food is well-prepared, and the service is attentive, though the portions could be slightly larger for the price. Overall, it's a great spot for a healthier, upscale Chinese meal."
