    "review": "I had high hopes for Toast, given its cozy atmosphere and fresh food options. The poached eggs on toast were decent, but the service was slow, and the kitchen seemed overwhelmed. While the food was tasty, the overall experience was marred by the long wait times and occasional disorganization. It’s a good spot for a casual brunch, but don’t expect speedy service."
