  "review": "The pH and TDS meter combo is a handy tool for anyone needing to test water quality, whether for home use or more specialized applications. It's compact and easy to carry around, which is a plus. The accuracy is good, and the calibration process is straightforward, though it would be nice if it came with more detailed instructions. Overall, a useful and reliable device."
