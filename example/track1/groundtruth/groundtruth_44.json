    "review": "I finally got to try MaFooCo after hearing so much about their Korean-Mexican fusion. The kimchi quesadilla was a delightful surprise, with just the right amount of spice and crunch. The tacos were flavorful and the beef was tender. While the menu is simple, the execution is spot-on, making it a must-try for food truck enthusiasts."
