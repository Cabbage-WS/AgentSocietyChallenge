  "review": "I had mixed experiences at Grande Oasis. The property is beautiful and well-maintained, but the lack of responsiveness from the staff when issues arose was frustrating. While the amenities are nice, the thin walls and occasional lack of parking made living here less enjoyable than expected. Overall, it\u2019s a decent place, but there\u2019s room for improvement in customer service and resident satisfaction."
