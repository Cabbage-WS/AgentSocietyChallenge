    "review": "I had a terrible experience with PRO Mobile Detailing. I scheduled an appointment well in advance, but they didn't show up or even bother to call. When I reached out, they were unapologetic and blamed me for their mistake. This lack of professionalism and poor communication is unacceptable. I won't be using their services again."
