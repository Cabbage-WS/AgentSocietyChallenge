  "review": "Herman's Coffee is a delightful addition to the neighborhood. The coffee is well-crafted, and the open-air setup with garage doors adds a unique charm. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is perfect for both relaxing and getting work done. I especially enjoyed the seasonal latte options and the rotating food trucks on weekends."
