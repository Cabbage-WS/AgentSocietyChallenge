    "review": "I had high hopes for Pho Le given its convenient location, but my experience was underwhelming. The pho was lukewarm and lacked the rich, flavorful broth I expect from Vietnamese cuisine. The staff was polite, but the overall quality of the food didn't justify the price. I wouldn't rush back, especially with better options nearby."
