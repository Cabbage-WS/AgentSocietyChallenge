  "review": "I recently purchased the PURESOUND Twisted Series Snare Wire for my 13-inch snare drum, and I am thoroughly impressed. The sound is crisp and articulate, even at lower tensions, which is exactly what I was looking for. The quality of the product is top-notch, and it's clear that PURESOUND has designed this with professional musicians in mind."
