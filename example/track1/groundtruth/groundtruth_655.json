    "review": "The Rooster is a fantastic spot with a great mission behind it. The food is comforting and well-executed, especially the matzo ball soup and sandwiches. The atmosphere is cozy and the service is friendly. It's a place where you can feel good about supporting a cause while enjoying a solid meal."
