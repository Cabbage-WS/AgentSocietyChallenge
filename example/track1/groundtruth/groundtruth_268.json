    "review": "I visited Strudelking hoping to try their famous strudels, but I was a bit disappointed. The apple strudel I bought was heavy and dense, and it didn't have the flaky texture I was expecting. The taste was decent, but it wasn't the best I've had. The owner was friendly, though, and the experience was pleasant overall."
