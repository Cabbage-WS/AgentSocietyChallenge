    "review": "I've been ordering from Quig's Pizza for years, and while the pizza is consistently good, I've noticed a few inconsistencies lately. The crust is always perfectly chewy, and the sauce has a great balance of flavors. However, the delivery times have been a bit unpredictable, and sometimes the toppings feel sparse. Overall, it's a solid neighborhood spot, but they could improve on consistency and service."
