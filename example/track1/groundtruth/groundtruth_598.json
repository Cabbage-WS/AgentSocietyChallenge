    "review": "South Philly Barbacoa exceeded my expectations! The lamb tacos were tender and flavorful, and the homemade tortillas added an extra layer of authenticity. The staff was incredibly welcoming, and the self-serve toppings bar allowed for a personalized experience. This is a must-visit spot for anyone craving authentic Mexican cuisine."
