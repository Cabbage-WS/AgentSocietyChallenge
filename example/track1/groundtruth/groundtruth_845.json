    "review": "I visited Fountain Square hoping for a pleasant dining experience, but it fell short in several areas. The food was mediocre, and the service was slow and inattentive. The outdoor ambiance was nice, but it wasn't enough to make up for the disappointing food and service. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."
