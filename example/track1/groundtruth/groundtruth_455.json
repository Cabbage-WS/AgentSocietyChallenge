    "review": "I decided to try 2 in One Cafe for a quick lunch, and while the concept of combining American breakfast with Asian fusion is interesting, the execution left me a bit underwhelmed. The food was decent but not exceptional, and the service was a bit slow despite the place not being busy. I might give it another try for breakfast, but for now, it's just an average experience."
