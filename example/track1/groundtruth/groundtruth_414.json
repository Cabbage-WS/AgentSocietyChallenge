  "review": "I found \"Alice in the Country of Hearts, Vol. 04\" to be a delightful continuation of the manga series, blending the whimsical elements of \"Alice in Wonderland\" with a darker, more intricate storyline. The characters are well-developed, and the artwork is visually stunning, making it a pleasure to read. While the plot can be a bit dense at times, it's engaging and keeps you wanting more."
