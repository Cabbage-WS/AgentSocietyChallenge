    "review": "Box of Cubans exceeded my expectations! The Cuban sandwich was absolutely delicious, packed with flavor, and the cilantro sauce was a game-changer. The owners were incredibly friendly and made me feel right at home. This hidden gem in the gas station is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Cuban food."
