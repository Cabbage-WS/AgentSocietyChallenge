    "review": "I decided to try Lucky Garden for the first time, and while the food was decent, it didn't blow me away. The service was quick, and the staff was friendly, but the flavors were a bit underwhelming. I ordered the General Tso's chicken, which was a bit too sweet for my taste, and the fried rice was average. It's a good option for a quick takeout meal, but I've had better Chinese food elsewhere."
