    "review": "Carrollwood Caf√© & Deli is a hidden gem with a cozy, casual atmosphere. The sandwiches are fresh and flavorful, though the portions could be a bit more generous for the price. The service is friendly, and the homemade soups are a highlight. A solid spot for a quick, satisfying lunch."
