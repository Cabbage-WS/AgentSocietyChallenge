    "review": "Roula's Pizza offers a decent pizza experience, but it's not without its flaws. The crust is thin and floppy, which I personally enjoy, but it might not be for everyone. The toppings are generous, but the overall flavor feels a bit underwhelming. Service was friendly, though a bit slow at times. It's a solid option for a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
