    "review": "I had a great experience at Los Jarritos! The breakfast burrito I ordered was packed with flavor and felt like a homemade meal. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was welcoming, even though it's a small, mostly take-out spot. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more of their authentic Mexican dishes."
