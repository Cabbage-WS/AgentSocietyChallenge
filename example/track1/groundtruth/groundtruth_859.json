    "review": "Humphrys Flag Company is a fascinating little shop packed with history and character. The collection of flags is impressive, ranging from vintage to modern designs, and the owner's knowledge is truly impressive. While the service can be a bit hit or miss, the experience of browsing through the flags and learning about their significance makes it worth a visit."
