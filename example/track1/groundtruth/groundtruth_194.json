    "review": "The Cuban Sandwich Festival was a fun and lively event with a great atmosphere! I enjoyed trying different Cuban sandwiches and exploring the variety of vendors. The live music and crowd made it even more enjoyable. While some lines were long, it was worth it for the delicious food. I’d definitely recommend it for anyone looking to experience a taste of Tampa’s Cuban culture!"
