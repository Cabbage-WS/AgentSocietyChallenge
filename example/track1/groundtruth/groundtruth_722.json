    "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Bonded Boutique. The selection of unique clothing and accessories is impressive, and the staff was friendly and helpful. While the prices for alterations seemed a bit high, the quality of the items and the overall vibe of the store made it worth visiting. Iâ€™ll definitely be back for more unique finds!"
