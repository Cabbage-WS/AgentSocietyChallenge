    "review": "I had a decent experience at Miller's Ale House. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was lively, especially with all the TVs for sports. However, the food was just average, and I expected a bit more from the menu. It's a good spot for drinks and casual dining, but I might try something different next time."
