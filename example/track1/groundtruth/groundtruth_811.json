    "review": "I had the pleasure of working with Kathryn from Prideaux Design on a complete backyard renovation, and the results exceeded my expectations. She listened to my ideas and transformed them into a stunning outdoor space that feels like a true oasis. Her attention to detail and creative vision made the entire process seamless and enjoyable. I highly recommend her for anyone looking to elevate their home design."
