    "review": "I had high hopes for Tacos 4G based on the reviews, but my experience was just average. The tacos were decent, but the flavors were a bit underwhelming, and the portions felt small for the price. The service was friendly, but the place was very loud, which made it hard to enjoy the meal. I might give it another try, but there are other options I prefer in the area."
