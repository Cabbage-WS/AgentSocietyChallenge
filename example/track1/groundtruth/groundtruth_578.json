    "review": "I had a terrible experience at JQ Motorsports. The car I purchased broke down within days, and the staff was unhelpful and dismissive when I tried to address the issue. This dealership clearly prioritizes profits over customer satisfaction, and I cannot recommend them to anyone. Save yourself the headache and avoid this place at all costs."
