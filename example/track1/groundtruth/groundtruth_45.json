    "review": "I decided to try Jaggie's Restaurant based on the mixed reviews, and my experience was somewhat underwhelming. The food was decent, but it lacked the bold flavors I was expecting from Caribbean cuisine. The portions were generous, which is a plus, but the overall taste was just average. I might give it another try to explore more dishes, but for now, it's just an okay spot."
