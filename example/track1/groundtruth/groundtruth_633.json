    "review": "Pizza Jawn delivers a solid pizza experience with a unique twist. The Grandma pie with its sesame seed crust is a standout, offering a flavorful and chewy texture. While the ordering process is a bit of a hassle, the quality of the pizza makes it worth the effort. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more of their styles!"
