    "review": "Ruth's Chris Steak House offers a solid dining experience with top-notch steaks and attentive service. The atmosphere is elegant, and the food quality is consistently high. While the prices are on the higher side, the quality justifies the cost. I enjoyed my meal, though I felt the sides could have been more memorable. Overall, it's a great spot for a special occasion."
