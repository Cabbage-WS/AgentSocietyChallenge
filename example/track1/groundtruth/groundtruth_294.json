    "review": "I had a solid experience at Royal Pizza. The cheesesteak was flavorful and satisfying, though a bit greasy, which is typical for the style. The staff was friendly and the service was quick. While the pizza wasn't the best I've ever had, it was decent and hit the spot for a quick meal. Overall, a good option for a casual bite in the neighborhood."
