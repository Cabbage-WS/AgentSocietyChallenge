  "review": "I recently tried the Zep Industrial Hardwood and Laminate Floor Cleaner and found it to be quite effective. It does a great job of removing spots and stains while maintaining the shine on my floors. The fast-drying formula is a plus, as it doesn't leave any residue and doesn't require rinsing, making cleanup quick and easy."
