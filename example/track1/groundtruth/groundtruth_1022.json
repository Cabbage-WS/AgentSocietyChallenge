  "review": "I had high hopes for Classic Spaghetti Western Steakhouse, but my experience was a bit mixed. The concept is fun, and the atmosphere is unique, but the food didn't quite live up to my expectations. My steak was overcooked, and the spaghetti was a bit bland. The service was friendly, but the overall experience left me feeling underwhelmed. I might give it another try, but I hope they improve the consistency of their dishes."
