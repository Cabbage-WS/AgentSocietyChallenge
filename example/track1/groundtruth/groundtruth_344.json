  "review": "I was impressed by the K&M Flute In-Bell Tripod Stand. It's sturdy and provides a secure base for my flute, which is essential for rehearsals and performances. The compact and portable design is a plus, making it easy to carry around, though I wish the price was a bit more competitive."
