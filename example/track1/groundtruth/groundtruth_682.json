    "review": "I had an incredible experience at East Falls Glassworks! The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and made the process of glassblowing feel accessible and fun. Despite the intense heat, the creativity and craftsmanship involved made it all worthwhile. I left with beautiful creations and a newfound appreciation for the art of glassblowing."
