    "review": "Grantstone Supermarket has a unique charm with its wide selection of Asian products, but the store could definitely use some improvements in cleanliness and organization. The staff is helpful, and the prices are reasonable, but the overall atmosphere feels a bit outdated. It's a good place for finding hard-to-find items, though it might not be for everyone."
