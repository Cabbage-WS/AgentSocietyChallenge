    "review": "I had a terrible experience with Roof Coating Specialist. They were late for the appointment, and the technician provided an outrageous quote that was way over my budget. When I declined, they tried to charge me a fee for the estimate, which was unprofessional. I ended up finding another company that did the job for a much fairer price. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
