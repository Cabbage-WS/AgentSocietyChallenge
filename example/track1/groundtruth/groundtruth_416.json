    "review": "I decided to try La Teresita Tex Mex and Bakery after hearing about their vegetarian options. While the atmosphere was simple, the service was friendly and the food arrived quickly. I had the tofu burrito, which was decent but lacked a bit of flavor. The bakery section looked impressive, but I didn't get a chance to try anything from there. Overall, it was an okay experience, but I expected a bit more from the taste."
