    "review": "I had high hopes for The View at CK's given its unique concept, but my experience fell short. The food was mediocre, and the service, while polite, was slow. The revolving view of the airport was interesting, but it wasn't enough to make up for the lackluster meal. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."
