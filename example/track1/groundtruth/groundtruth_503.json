    "review": "I visited City Gourmet Deli for a quick lunch and found the staff to be friendly and the sandwiches to be decent. However, I noticed some inconsistencies in the freshness of the ingredients, which was a bit disappointing. While the convenience and service are good, the quality control could use some improvement to fully meet expectations."
