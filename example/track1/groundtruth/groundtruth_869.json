    "review": "Time offers a unique experience with its multiple atmospheres, but it can be hit or miss. The live music downstairs was enjoyable, but the upstairs dance floor was overly crowded and sticky. The whiskey bar was a nice escape, though the service felt a bit slow. Overall, it's a fun spot, but the packed vibe isn't for everyone."
