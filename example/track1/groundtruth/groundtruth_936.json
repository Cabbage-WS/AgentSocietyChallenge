    "review": "I visited HaoTea expecting a decent bubble tea experience, but it fell a bit short of my expectations. The drinks were okay, but they lacked the depth of flavor Iâ€™ve had at other bubble tea places. The service was slow due to only one worker handling everything, which was a bit frustrating. However, the ambiance was nice, and the prices were reasonable."
