  "review": "Victoria's is a great spot for a quick, affordable lunch. The Cuban sandwich was tasty, though not the most authentic I've had. The garbanzo bean soup was a nice surprise and added a comforting touch to the meal. Friendly service and a cozy atmosphere make it a solid choice for a casual dining experience."
