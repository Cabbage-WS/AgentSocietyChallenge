    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Thach Used Tires. I brought in my car with a flat tire, and they told me it would take 30 minutes to fix. After waiting for over an hour, they still hadn't started working on my car. The staff was unhelpful and seemed more interested in chatting with each other than addressing my issue. I ended up leaving without getting my tire fixed and won't be returning."
