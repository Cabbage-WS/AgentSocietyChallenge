    "review": "I visit this Starbucks occasionally, and while the staff is generally friendly, the service can be quite slow, especially during peak times. The outdoor seating is a nice touch, but the overall experience feels inconsistent. I wish the store could improve its efficiency to match the charm of the Chestnut Hill neighborhood."
