    "review": "I visited Great Clips for a quick haircut and found the experience to be average. The stylist was efficient but didn't offer much in terms of consultation or personalization. The price was reasonable, but the cut wasn't anything special. It's a decent option for a basic trim, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
