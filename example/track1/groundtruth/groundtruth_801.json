    "review": "Burnin Barber-Que and More offers a unique and flavorful BBQ experience. The ribs were perfectly smoked, and the sides were well-prepared, though the portion sizes could be a bit more generous. The atmosphere is cozy, and the staff is friendly, making it a great spot for a casual meal."
