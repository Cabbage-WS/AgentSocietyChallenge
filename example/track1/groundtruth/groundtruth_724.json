    "review": "I had a decent experience at Boston Market. The rotisserie chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the sides were satisfying. The staff was friendly and efficient, which made the visit pleasant. While the prices have gone up a bit, the quality of the food still makes it worth it for a quick, comforting meal."
