  "review": "\"Yes, Master\" by Michael Earl Craig offers a unique blend of documentary and imaginative poetry that challenges traditional pastoral themes. The vivid and often unsettling imagery, such as the man's desire to touch a horse and the lives of two gay donkeys, creates a compelling and thought-provoking read. While it may not be for everyone, I found the poetic exploration of the contemporary West both intriguing and deeply reflective."
