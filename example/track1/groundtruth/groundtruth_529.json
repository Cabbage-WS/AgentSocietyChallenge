    "review": "I had an incredible experience at BoardWalk Vibes! The seafood was fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The owners were incredibly friendly and made sure I had all the information I needed about the menu. I tried the Blue Crab Fries, and they were absolutely deliciousâ€”worth every penny! I can't wait to visit again and try more of their offerings."
