    "review": "Ochatto Hot Pot offers a modern and clean atmosphere with a decent selection of hot pot ingredients. The broth flavors are satisfying, though the spicy option could be a bit more authentic. Service was attentive, and the experience was enjoyable overall, making it a good spot for a casual hot pot meal."
