    "review": "El Coqui offers a unique and flavorful Puerto Rican dining experience. The food was rich in taste, especially the Mofongo and Arroz con Pollo, which were both delicious and authentic. The service was a bit slow, but the friendly staff made up for it. A great spot for trying something new and satisfying your taste buds."
