    "review": "Alla Spina has a great atmosphere and a unique menu, but the food didn't quite live up to my expectations. The pretzel bites with beer cheese were a highlight, but some dishes felt overly salty or underwhelming. I appreciate the effort, but it didn't fully deliver on the promise of a Vetri experience."
