    "review": "This 7-Eleven is conveniently located, but it lacks some of the typical 7-Eleven staples like Arizona Iced Tea. The staff was friendly, but the store felt a bit understocked. It's a decent spot for a quick stop, but it could use some improvements in product variety and overall cleanliness."
