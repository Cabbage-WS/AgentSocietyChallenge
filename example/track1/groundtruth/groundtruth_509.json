  "review": "\"The Tomb of Dracula Volume 1\" is a compelling start to the series, blending classic horror with the Marvel universe. The artwork is vivid, and the introduction of Blade adds an exciting edge to the narrative. While it sets the stage for what's to come, it's a bit slow in pacing, but still a must-read for horror and comic fans."
