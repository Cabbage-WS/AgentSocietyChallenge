    "review": "I had high expectations for Cigar City Brewing, but the experience fell a bit flat. The beer selection was impressive, but the service felt cold and uninviting. I overheard staff making jokes about customers, which was off-putting. While the beer was good, the overall vibe didnâ€™t match the hype."
