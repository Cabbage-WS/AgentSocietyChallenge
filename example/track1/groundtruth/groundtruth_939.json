    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Vip Nails & Spa. The staff was friendly, and the ambiance was pleasant, but the service quality was inconsistent. My nails looked decent, but they chipped faster than expected. While the price was reasonable, I expected better durability for the cost. Overall, it's an okay spot, but there's room for improvement."
