    "review": "I had high hopes for Franco's Pizza Ristorante, but my experience was disappointing. The pizza was bland and lacked flavor, and the delivery took much longer than expected. While the staff was polite, the overall quality of the food and service didn't meet my expectations. I won't be returning anytime soon."
