    "review": "I stopped by this Dunkin' for a quick coffee and a donut. The staff was friendly, and the coffee was decent, but the donut I got was a bit stale. It's a typical Dunkin' experience, nothing extraordinary but not terrible either. I might give it another try, but there are better options nearby."
