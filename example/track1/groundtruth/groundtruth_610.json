    "review": "I had an amazing experience at Philadelphia Bikesmith! The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, making me feel right at home. They took the time to explain everything and didn’t push unnecessary upgrades, which I really appreciated. This is hands down the best bike shop I’ve ever visited!"
