    "review": "I decided to try Mediterra Grill based on the mixed reviews, and my experience was just average. The food was decent, but it lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for. The service was quick, which was a plus, but the overall experience didn't leave a strong impression. I might give it another try, but I wasn't blown away."
