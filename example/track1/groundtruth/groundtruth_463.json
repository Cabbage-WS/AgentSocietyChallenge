    "review": "Jamonera offers a delightful tapas experience with a cozy atmosphere and flavorful dishes. The octopus and goat cheese croquettes were standouts, and the sangria added a perfect touch to the meal. While the service was a bit slow, the food more than made up for it. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more of their menu."
