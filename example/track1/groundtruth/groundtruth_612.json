    "review": "This Burger King location is a hit or miss. The service is painfully slow, and I've had multiple experiences where my order was incorrect or incomplete. The staff seems unorganized, and the overall atmosphere is lackluster. While the food is typical of what you'd expect from BK, the poor service and inconsistent quality make it hard to recommend."
