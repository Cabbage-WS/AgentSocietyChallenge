    "review": "I had a terrible experience with Mad Batter Bakery. I ordered a cake for a family gathering, but the owner was unresponsive and unprofessional. She failed to deliver the cake on time, leaving us without a dessert for our event. This lack of reliability and communication is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this bakery due to their poor service."
