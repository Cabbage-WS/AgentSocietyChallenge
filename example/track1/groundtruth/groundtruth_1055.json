  "review": "Queen Village Laundry is a decent spot for getting your laundry done. The machines are functional, and the place is generally clean, which is a plus. However, the occasional smoking issue and the slightly awkward interaction with the staff can be a bit off-putting. Overall, it gets the job done, but it's not without its quirks."
