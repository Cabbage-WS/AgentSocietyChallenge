  "review": "I had a mixed experience with Phil Kramer Photographers. The quality of the photos was decent, but the overall process felt disorganized. I had to follow up multiple times to get updates on my order, which was frustrating. While the final product was satisfactory, the lack of communication left me feeling underwhelmed."
