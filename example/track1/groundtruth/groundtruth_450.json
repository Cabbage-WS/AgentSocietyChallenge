    "review": "I visited Paris Nails for a basic manicure, and while the service was decent and the prices were reasonable, I wasn't entirely satisfied. The nail techs were friendly, but the overall cleanliness of the salon left something to be desired. My nails turned out okay, but the shape wasn't as precise as I would have liked. It's a good spot for a quick, affordable fix, but I might look elsewhere for a more polished experience."
