    "review": "I had a pretty good time at Ali Baba Cafe & Hookah Bar. The hookah flavors were diverse and the atmosphere was lively, though a bit loud for my taste. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed. It’s a great spot for a casual hangout with friends, especially if you’re into hookah."
