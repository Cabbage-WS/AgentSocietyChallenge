    "review": "Bob's Crab House is a hidden gem! The seafood is incredibly fresh, and the seasoning is spot-on. I tried the blue crabs and the Cajun shrimp, and both were absolutely delicious. The wait time is a bit long, but it's totally worth it for the quality of the food. I'll definitely be coming back!"
