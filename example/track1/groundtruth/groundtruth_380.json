    "review": "I had a mixed experience with Boulton's Pool Service. On one hand, their team was responsive and the pool maintenance was generally well-done, keeping the water clean and balanced. However, I did encounter a minor scheduling issue once, which was quickly resolved. Overall, they provide decent service, though there's room for improvement in communication and reliability."
