    "review": "Donna's Bar is a hidden gem with a unique charm. The Polish food is delicious, especially the pierogies, and the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. Friday night karaoke adds a fun twist, though it can get a bit crowded. Overall, a great spot for a casual night out with friendly locals."
