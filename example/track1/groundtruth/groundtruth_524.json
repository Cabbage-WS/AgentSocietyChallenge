    "review": "I had a quick and satisfying experience at Jimmy John's. The sandwiches are fresh, and the service is incredibly fast, which is perfect for a busy day. While it may not be the most gourmet option, it's a reliable and affordable choice for a quick bite. I enjoyed the simplicity and efficiency of the place."
