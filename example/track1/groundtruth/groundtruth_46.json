    "review": "New China Court offers solid, no-frills Chinese takeout at a great price. The food is consistently good, with standout dishes like the General Tso's chicken and shrimp fried rice. While the ambiance is nothing special, the quick service and friendly staff make it a reliable choice for a quick meal."
