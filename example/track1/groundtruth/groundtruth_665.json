    "review": "I visited NY Bagel Cafe & Deli hoping for a decent bagel experience, but it fell a bit short of my expectations. The bagels were average, and the overall selection felt limited. The service was friendly, and the place was clean, but the food didn't quite live up to the name. I might give it another try, but I'll probably stick to other local spots for now."
