    "review": "The Ugly American has a cozy atmosphere and a decent beer selection, but the food left me feeling underwhelmed. The service was friendly, but the menu options were limited, and the dishes I tried lacked the flavor I was hoping for. It's a good spot for a casual drink, but I wouldn't rush back for the food."
