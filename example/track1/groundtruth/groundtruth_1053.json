  "review": "El Provocon offers a great variety of authentic Spanish dishes at affordable prices. The food is flavorful and the portions are generous, making it a solid choice for a satisfying meal. However, the service can be slow, especially during peak times, which is the only downside. Overall, it's a good spot for a quick, tasty bite."
