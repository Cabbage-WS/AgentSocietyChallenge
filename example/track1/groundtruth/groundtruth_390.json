    "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Cafe Nhu Quynh. The banh mi I ordered was flavorful and the bread was perfectly crispy. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was clean and welcoming. While it may not be the most upscale place, itâ€™s a great spot for affordable and tasty Vietnamese food."
