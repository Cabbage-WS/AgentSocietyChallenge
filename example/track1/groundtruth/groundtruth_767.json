    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Nicholas Cosmetic Dental Center. The office was clean and the staff was friendly, but the dental work I received didn't meet my expectations. My filling was repaired multiple times within a short period, which was frustrating. I appreciate the effort, but I expected better quality of service."
