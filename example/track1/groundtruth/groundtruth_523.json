    "review": "Venzo's Pizza offers a solid New York-style pizza experience with generous slices and a thin, crispy crust. The lunch special is a great deal, providing plenty of food for a reasonable price. While the atmosphere is casual and no-frills, the quality of the pizza makes it worth a visit."
