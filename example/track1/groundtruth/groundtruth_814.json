    "review": "One Pound Cheesesteaks offers a solid Philly experience with a massive, satisfying cheesesteak at a great price. The meat is well-seasoned, and the bread holds up well, making it a filling and enjoyable meal. While the location is a bit rough, the quality of the sandwich makes it worth the visit for a hearty, late-night treat."
