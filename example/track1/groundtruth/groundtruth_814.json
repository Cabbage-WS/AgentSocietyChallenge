  "review": "Bain's Deli offers a decent selection of sandwiches and deli options, but the experience can be hit or miss. The staff is friendly, and the food is fresh, but some items feel overpriced for what you get. I enjoyed my sandwich, though it didn't quite live up to the hype from other reviews. It's a good spot for a quick lunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
