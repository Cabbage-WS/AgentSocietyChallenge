    "review": "I visited Earl of Sandwich expecting a decent meal, but my experience was mixed. The sandwiches were tasty, but the portions felt smaller than I anticipated. The service was quick, but the staff could have been more attentive. Overall, it was an okay visit, but I might try a different sandwich place next time."
