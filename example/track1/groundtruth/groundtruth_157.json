    "review": "I visited The Flavor Spot hoping for a satisfying meal, but my experience was mixed. The jerk chicken was flavorful, but the sides were underwhelming. The mac and cheese was dry, and the cabbage lacked seasoning. While the service was polite, the overall quality didn't meet my expectations. I might give it another try, but I was a bit disappointed."
