    "review": "I absolutely love The Kava Bar! The atmosphere is so chill and welcoming, and the staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I tried the Kachata, and it was a fantastic introduction to kava. This place is a hidden gem and a great alternative to traditional bars. Iâ€™ll definitely be coming back!"
