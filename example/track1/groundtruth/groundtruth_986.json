  "review": "I had a decent experience at Suitsupply, though the service was a bit hit or miss. The staff was helpful in finding the right suit, but the tailor seemed grumpy and uninterested. Overall, the quality of the suits is great, and I left with a sharp outfit, but the customer service could use some improvement."
