    "review": "I had high hopes for Pizza House Express, but my experience was disappointing. The pizza was mediocre, and the service was lackluster. I ordered delivery, and it arrived cold, which was a major letdown. While the staff seemed friendly, the overall quality just didn't meet my expectations. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."
