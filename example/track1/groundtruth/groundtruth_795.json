    "review": "Apna Kabab House offers a flavorful and authentic experience with its Indian and Pakistani dishes. The butter chicken and seekh kababs were particularly delicious, showcasing a perfect balance of spices and flavors. While the service could be a bit more attentive, the food quality and taste make it worth a visit."
