    "review": "I decided to give Uncle Tomy's a try after hearing mixed reviews, but my experience was disappointing. The pizza I ordered was bland and tasted like it had been sitting out for too long. The delivery was quick, but the quality of the food didn't match the effort. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."
