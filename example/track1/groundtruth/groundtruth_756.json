  "review": "\"The Unusual Suspects\" captivated me with its blend of fairy-tale characters and a modern, engaging plot. The dynamic between the Sisters Grimm and their teacher, Snow White, adds a delightful twist to the classic stories. While the plot was slightly predictable, the creative use of fairy-tale elements and the characters' development made it a thoroughly enjoyable read."
