    "review": "My experience with Hertz was incredibly frustrating. Despite having a reservation, I was told they had no cars available, and the staff was unhelpful and dismissive. I had to wait over an hour, only to be left without a solution. This was the worst car rental experience I've ever had, and I won't be using Hertz again."
