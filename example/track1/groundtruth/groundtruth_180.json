  "review": "I bought this game for my Sega Genesis, and it was a mixed experience. The graphics are good for its time, and it's fun playing as Batman and Robin. However, the controls can be a bit clunky, and the game gets frustrating at higher difficulties. Overall, it's a decent addition to the Batman game collection, but not the best out there."
