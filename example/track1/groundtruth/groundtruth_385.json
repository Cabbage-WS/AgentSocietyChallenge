    "review": "Thinh An Kitchen & Tofu offers a delightful experience with its wide variety of Vietnamese dishes. The pho was flavorful and the banh mi was fresh and delicious. The service was quick, and the atmosphere was clean and inviting. I'll definitely be back to try more from their extensive menu."
