    "review": "I had a terrible experience at this McDonald's. The service was painfully slow, and the food was cold and unappetizing. I ordered a Big Mac and fries, but the burger was dry, and the fries tasted like they had been sitting out for hours. I won't be returning to this location anytime soon."
