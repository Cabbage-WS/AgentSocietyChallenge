    "review": "The Brass Tap has a fantastic beer selection and a great atmosphere for hanging out with friends. The service can be hit or miss, but the food is surprisingly good for bar fare. I enjoyed the creative menu options and the outdoor seating, though the noise level can get a bit high during busy times. Overall, it's a solid spot for a casual night out."
