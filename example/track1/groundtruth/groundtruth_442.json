    "review": "Catalina Brewing Company offers a unique and welcoming atmosphere with a great selection of beers. I particularly enjoyed the Pecan Doppelbock and the Cherry Tanked Stout. The staff was friendly, and the bike-themed decor added a fun touch. While not every beer stood out, the overall experience was enjoyable, and Iâ€™d definitely return to try more brews."
