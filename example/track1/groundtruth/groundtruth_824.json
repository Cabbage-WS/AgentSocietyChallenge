    "review": "This Taco Bell location is a complete disaster. The service is painfully slow, and the staff seems completely disorganized. I ordered through the drive-thru, and it took over 30 minutes to get my food, only to find out half of my order was missing. When I tried to address the issue, the staff was rude and unhelpful. This experience was frustrating and a waste of time. I won't be returning anytime soon."
