  "review": "The service at Buzz Cafe was incredibly disappointing. I arrived early in the morning, only to find the cafe closed despite the posted hours. This inconsistency is frustrating and unprofessional. I expected better from a place with such positive reviews, but this experience left me feeling unwelcome and inconvenienced."
