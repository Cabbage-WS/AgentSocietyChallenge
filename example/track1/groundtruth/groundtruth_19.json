    "review": "This Wawa location has potential, but it falls short in execution. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and the wait times for food were unreasonably long. While the convenience of the location is great, the disorganization and lack of customer service made the experience frustrating. I hope they can improve their operations to match the expectations of a Wawa."
