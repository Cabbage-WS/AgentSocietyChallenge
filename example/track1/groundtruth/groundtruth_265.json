    "review": "I enjoyed my meal at Zoe's Kitchen, especially the Mediterranean chicken with grilled veggies. The food was fresh and flavorful, though the portion size felt a bit small for the price. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was clean and inviting. I'll definitely come back to try more dishes."
