    "review": "I had a great experience at All The Way Live! The food was fresh, flavorful, and truly lived up to its name. The raw vegan options were creative and delicious, especially the chickpea chili and the raw lasagna. The service was a bit slow, but the owner's warmth and passion for healthy eating made up for it. I'll definitely be back to try more dishes!"
