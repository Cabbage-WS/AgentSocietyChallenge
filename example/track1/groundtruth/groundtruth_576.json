    "review": "I had a great time at 82 West Distilling! The rum samples were fantastic, and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I especially enjoyed the Coconut Breeze rum—smooth and flavorful. The outdoor seating added to the relaxed vibe, making it a perfect spot to unwind. I’ll definitely be back to try more of their unique blends!"
