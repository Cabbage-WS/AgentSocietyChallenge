    "review": "I tried the Shoyu Ramen at Ichicoro Imoto, and while the broth had a decent flavor, it felt a bit underwhelming compared to other ramen places I've been to. The pork belly was tender, but the portion felt small for the price. The service was quick, but the overall experience didn't leave me craving to come back."
