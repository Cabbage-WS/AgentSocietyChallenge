    "review": "I had high hopes for Shlomo & Vitos Delicatessen, but my experience was mixed. The food was decent, but not exceptional, and the service felt a bit slow. The portions were generous, but the quality didn't quite match the price. I might give it another try, but it didn't blow me away."
