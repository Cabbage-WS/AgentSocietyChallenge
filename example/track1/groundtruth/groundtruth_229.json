    "review": "I had high hopes for Aroma Cafe based on the reviews, but my experience was disappointing. The coffee was weak and lacked flavor, and my panini was underwhelming. The service was friendly, but the overall quality didn't meet my expectations. I might give it another try, but I was left wanting more."
