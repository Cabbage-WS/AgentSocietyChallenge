    "review": "I had a solid experience at Lulu's Pizza Bar. The pizza was flavorful, with fresh ingredients and a crispy crust that hit the spot. The service was friendly, and the casual atmosphere made it a great spot for a quick meal. While it wasn't the most exceptional pizza I've ever had, it was definitely enjoyable and worth a return visit."
