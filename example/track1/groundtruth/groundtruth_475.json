  "review": "\"King of Thorn, Vol. 6\" continues the intense and dark narrative that I've come to expect from this series. The artwork is stunning, and the story keeps me on the edge of my seat, even though I sometimes wish for a bit more character development. Overall, it's a satisfying addition to the collection, and I'm eager to see how the story unfolds in the next volumes."
