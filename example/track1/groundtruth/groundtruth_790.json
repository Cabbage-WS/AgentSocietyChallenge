    "review": "The dim sum at Nom Wah Philadelphia was decent, but not exceptional. I enjoyed some dishes like the pork buns and shrimp dumplings, but others were underwhelming. The atmosphere was nice, but the service felt a bit slow. Overall, it's a good option for dim sum, but there are better places in Philly."
