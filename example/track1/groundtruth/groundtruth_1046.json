  "review": "I had a decent experience at Buddy Brew Coffee in the Tampa airport. The coffee was flavorful and the service was quick, which is always appreciated when you're in a rush. However, the staff could be a bit more attentive and friendly. Overall, it's a good option if you're looking for a quality coffee fix before a flight."
