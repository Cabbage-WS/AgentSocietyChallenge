  "review": "I stopped by Guava & Java hoping for a decent breakfast before my flight, but I was left disappointed. The bagel I ordered was stale, and the cream cheese was overly generous, making it difficult to eat. The coffee was average at best. While the staff was polite, the overall experience didn't meet my expectations for an airport eatery."
