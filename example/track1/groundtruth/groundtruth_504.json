    "review": "I visited Chirco Performance & Restoration to get some parts for my VW, and while the staff was knowledgeable, the service felt a bit slow. I had to wait longer than expected to get help, which was frustrating. However, the parts they recommended worked well, so it wasn't a complete loss. Overall, it was an average experience."
