  "review": "I found these USB cables to be quite useful, especially for recharging my SIXAXIS controller and connecting my PSP to my PlayStation 3. The 10-foot length is convenient, and the gold-plated connectors seem to ensure a good connection. While they're a bit pricier than generic cables, the quality and compatibility with my devices make them worth the purchase."
