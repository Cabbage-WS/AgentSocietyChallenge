    "review": "Jones offers a delightful mix of comfort food and retro charm. The chicken and waffles were a standout, with perfectly crispy chicken and fluffy waffles. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere felt like stepping into a 70s sitcom. While the prices are a bit steep, the experience is worth it for a cozy night out."
