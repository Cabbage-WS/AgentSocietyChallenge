    "review": "I stopped by The Great American Bagel at Tampa International Airport for a quick breakfast before my flight. The Asiago Omelet bagel I ordered was decent, but it could have used a bit more filling to make it more satisfying. The service was fast, which was appreciated, but the overall experience was just average. It’s a good option if you’re in a hurry, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it."
