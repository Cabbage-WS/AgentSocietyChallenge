    "review": "I had a mixed experience with Walter Wood Real Estate. On one hand, they were responsive when I had urgent issues, like a broken appliance, and the rent was reasonable. However, some repairs took longer than expected, and the initial move-in condition of the apartment wasn't great. Overall, it's an okay option, but there's room for improvement in maintenance efficiency."
