  "review": "\"Let's Draw!\" is a fun and engaging game for the Nintendo DS that encourages creativity and artistic skills. The ability to animate and add sound to drawings brings an extra layer of enjoyment, making it a great educational tool for children. While the mini-games are a nice addition, the core drawing experience is what really shines."
