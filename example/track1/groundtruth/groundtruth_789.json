  "review": "\"The Poet Assassinated\" by Apollinaire is a fascinating and avant-garde novella that blends surrealism with a satirical edge. The narrative, while fragmented and often obscure, offers a unique glimpse into the artistic and literary milieu of early 20th-century Paris. Despite its brevity, the book leaves a lasting impression and is a must-read for fans of modernist literature."
