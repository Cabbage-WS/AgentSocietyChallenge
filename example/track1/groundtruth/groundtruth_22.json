    "review": "I visited Great Clips Encore Commons hoping for a quick and decent haircut, but the experience left me disappointed. The stylist didn't seem to pay attention to my preferences, and the result was uneven and not what I asked for. While the price is affordable, the quality of service didn't meet my expectations. I might give it another try, but I'm not confident based on this visit."
