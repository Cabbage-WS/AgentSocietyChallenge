    "review": "Dealing with Meritus Associations has been an absolute nightmare. Their lack of professionalism and responsiveness is appalling. Iâ€™ve had to follow up countless times just to get basic information, and even then, their answers are vague and unhelpful. Avoid this company at all costs if you value your sanity."
