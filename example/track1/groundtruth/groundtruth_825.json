    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Sunflower Beauty Salon. The service was rushed, and the staff seemed uninterested in my needs. I specifically asked for a gel manicure, but it was done poorly, and my nails started peeling within a day. I won't be returning and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
