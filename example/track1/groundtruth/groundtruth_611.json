  "review": "\"The Wrong Side of Magic\" is a delightful read that brings a unique twist to the traditional fantasy genre. Hudson's journey through Logos, a land ruled by words and memories, is both whimsical and thought-provoking. The characters are charming, and the plot keeps you engaged from start to finish."
