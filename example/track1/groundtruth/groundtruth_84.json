    "review": "The Coronet offers a unique dining experience with its charming atmosphere and creative menu. The outdoor seating and live music add to the ambiance, making it a great spot for a special occasion. While the food was flavorful, some dishes could benefit from better temperature control. Overall, it's a solid choice for a memorable meal in Tucson."
