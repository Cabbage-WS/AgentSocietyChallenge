    "review": "I decided to give Super Fratelli's Pizza a try based on the mixed reviews, and my experience was decent but not outstanding. The pizza had a good crust and flavorful sauce, but the cheese was a bit sparse. The service was quick, but the overall quality didn't quite live up to the hype. It's a solid option for a quick bite, but I've had better pizza elsewhere."
