    "review": "This Starbucks is a typical campus location, with a mix of good and not-so-great aspects. The staff is generally friendly, and the drinks are consistent with what you'd expect from Starbucks. However, the line can get long during peak times, and the lack of rewards benefits is a bit disappointing. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick coffee, but it's not without its flaws."
