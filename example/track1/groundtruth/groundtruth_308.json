  "review": "I recently bought this set of mini wire brushes for some small cleaning and detailing tasks. The brushes are well-made, with sturdy handles and strong bristles that get the job done efficiently. While the brass brushes are great for delicate surfaces, the stainless steel ones are perfect for tougher jobs, making this set quite versatile for various projects."
