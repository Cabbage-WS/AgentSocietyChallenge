    "review": "Teaholic has a great atmosphere and offers a variety of tea options, though some drinks can be hit or miss. I tried the Jasmine milk tea, which was decent but could have used a bit more tea flavor. The service was friendly, and the decor is lovely, making it a nice spot to relax. Overall, it's a solid choice for boba in Tucson, especially if you're near the university."
