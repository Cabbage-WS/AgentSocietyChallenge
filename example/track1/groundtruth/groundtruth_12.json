    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Sansom Cleaners. While they were able to handle basic dry cleaning tasks, I encountered issues with a tailored item that didn't turn out as expected. The staff was polite, but the quality of the work didn't meet my expectations, especially for the price. I might consider trying them again for simpler tasks, but I'm hesitant to trust them with more complex alterations."
