    "review": "I had a decent experience at Genji Sushi Bar & Izakaya. The ramen was flavorful, though the portion felt a bit small for the price. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere inside Whole Foods was convenient. While it wasn't the best ramen I've had, it was a solid option for a quick meal."
