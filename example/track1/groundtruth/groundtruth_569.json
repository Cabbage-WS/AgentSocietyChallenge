    "review": "I had a great experience ordering from Michael's Chinese Kitchen. The food was flavorful and arrived quickly, which is always a plus. The General Tso's chicken was particularly delicious, with the right balance of spice and sweetness. While the ambiance isn't much to write home about, the food more than makes up for it. I'll definitely be ordering again!"
