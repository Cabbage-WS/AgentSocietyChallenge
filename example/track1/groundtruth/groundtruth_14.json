    "review": "I had a decent experience at Booker's Restaurant and Bar. The ambiance was nice, and the food was tasty, especially the buffalo cauliflower. However, the service was a bit slow, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, it's a good spot for a casual meal, but they could improve on their service."
