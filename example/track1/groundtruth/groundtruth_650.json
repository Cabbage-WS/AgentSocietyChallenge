    "review": "I visited Rodolfo's Taco Shop for the first time, and while the food was decent, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The carne asada tacos were flavorful but a bit greasy, and the service was quick but not particularly friendly. The free chips were a nice touch, but the overall experience felt average compared to other Mexican spots I've tried. I might give it another shot, but it's not a must-visit."
