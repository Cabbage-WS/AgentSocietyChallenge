  "review": "I had a terrible experience at Sticky's Smoke Shop. The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful, making me feel unwelcome from the moment I walked in. The selection was limited, and the prices were higher than other shops in the area. I won't be returning and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
