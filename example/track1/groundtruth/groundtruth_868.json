    "review": "I decided to try Los Bertos based on its proximity and the mixed reviews I read. Unfortunately, my experience was underwhelming. The food lacked flavor, and my order was not prepared as requested. The service was also unremarkable, with no effort to make up for the shortcomings. While the prices are reasonable, the quality just doesn't match up. I won't be rushing back."
