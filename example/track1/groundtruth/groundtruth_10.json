    "review": "I had an exceptional experience at Family Eyecare At Westchase. The staff was incredibly friendly and professional, and Dr. Mertzlufft was thorough and attentive during my eye exam. The COVID-19 protocols were well-implemented, making me feel safe and comfortable throughout my visit. I highly recommend this place for anyone in need of quality eye care."
