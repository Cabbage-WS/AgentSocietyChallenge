    "review": "Tsaocaa is a hidden gem in Manayunk! The bubble tea is fresh and flavorful, with real fruit and high-quality ingredients. I especially loved the Honey Citrus Lime Jasmine Tea and the Mango Green Tea with Milk Foam. The chicken wings and sandwiches are also a pleasant surprise—crispy, juicy, and packed with flavor. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. I’ll definitely be back for more!"
