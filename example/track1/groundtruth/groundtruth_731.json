  "review": "\"The Vampire Diaries #11\" continues the compelling narrative of Grams' journey, blending supernatural elements with the social activism of the 1960s. The character development is strong, and the artwork complements the story well, making it a quick and enjoyable read. I appreciated the depth added to the vampire lore and the exploration of Grams' growing powers."
