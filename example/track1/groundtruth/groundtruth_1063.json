  "review": "O'Neals Pub is a solid spot for a casual night out. The atmosphere is friendly, and the happy hour specials are a great deal. The staff is attentive, and the food, while nothing fancy, hits the spot. I enjoyed the laid-back vibe and the variety of drink options. Definitely worth checking out for a relaxed evening."
