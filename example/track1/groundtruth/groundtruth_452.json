    "review": "I visited Hair Cuttery hoping for a decent haircut, but the experience was mixed. The stylist seemed more focused on selling products than listening to my preferences. While the haircut itself wasn't terrible, it didn't meet my expectations. The salon was busy, which made the atmosphere a bit chaotic. Overall, it was an average experience, but I might try a different stylist next time."
