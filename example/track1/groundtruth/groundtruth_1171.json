  "review": "Honey's offers a unique experience with its Buffalo-inspired menu and lively atmosphere. The wings were flavorful and the Beef on Weck was a standout, though the fries could have been warmer. The staff was friendly, and the outdoor seating was a nice touch. I'd recommend it for a casual meal with friends."
