    "review": "I had high hopes for NYO Food Truck given its unique menu, but my experience was mixed. I tried the ostrich burger, which was flavorful but slightly overcooked. The concept is cool, and the staff was friendly, but the execution could use some refinement. It's worth checking out for the novelty, but I expected a bit more from the taste."
