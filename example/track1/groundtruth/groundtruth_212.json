    "review": "Peter Piper Pizza is a fun spot for families, especially with kids. The pizza was decent, though not exceptional, and the arcade games kept the kids entertained. However, the place was quite crowded and a bit messy, which took away from the experience. Overall, itâ€™s a good option for a casual outing but could use some improvements in cleanliness and crowd management."
