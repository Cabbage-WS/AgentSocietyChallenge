    "review": "I visited Brewlands Bar and Billiards for a casual night out. The pool tables were well-maintained, and the atmosphere was relaxed. However, the service was a bit slow, and the food options were underwhelming. Overall, it's a decent spot for a game of pool, but there's room for improvement."
