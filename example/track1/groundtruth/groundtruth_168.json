    "review": "I finally got a chance to try Philly Style Bagels, and I was impressed by the freshness and flavor of their bagels. The everything bagel was particularly delicious, with a nice crunch on the outside and a soft, chewy interior. While I wish they had a toaster on-site, the bagels didn't really need it. Overall, a great spot for bagel lovers!"
