    "review": "Oronzo Italian offers a unique twist on Italian cuisine with their fresh pasta and creative dishes like the chicken parm burrito. The food is flavorful, and the service is friendly, making it a great spot for a quick, satisfying meal. While the pizza crust is a bit too thin for my taste, the overall experience is enjoyable, and Iâ€™d definitely come back to try more items on the menu."
