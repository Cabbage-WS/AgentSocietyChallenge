    "review": "El Berraco offers a unique and fun dining experience with its submarine-themed decor and creative seafood dishes. The food was fresh and flavorful, especially the chile relleno tacos and the ceviche trio, which were standout dishes. While the prices are a bit high, the quality and creativity of the dishes make it worth a visit. Service was friendly and attentive, adding to the overall enjoyable experience."
