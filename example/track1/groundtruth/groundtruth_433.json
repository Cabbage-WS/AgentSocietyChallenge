    "review": "I had a mixed experience with Arizona Bug Doctor. The technician was knowledgeable and thorough during the service, but the scheduling process was frustrating. I had to follow up multiple times to confirm my appointment, which was inconvenient. Overall, the service was decent, but the communication could be improved."
