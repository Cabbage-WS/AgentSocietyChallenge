    "review": "I visited Paletas Y Helados Bambino on a hot afternoon, and the experience was delightful. The variety of ice cream flavors was impressive, and I particularly enjoyed the creamy texture and rich flavors of the strawberry cheesecake and pistachio scoops. The service was a bit slow, but the friendly staff made up for it. Overall, it's a great spot for a sweet treat, especially given the reasonable prices."
