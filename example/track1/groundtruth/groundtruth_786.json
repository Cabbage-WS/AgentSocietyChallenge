    "review": "Mother Hubbard's Caf√© offers a unique and flavorful breakfast experience with its Southwestern-inspired dishes. The green corn waffles were a standout, full of rich, savory flavors that made the meal memorable. While the service was a bit slow, the friendly staff and creative menu make it worth a return visit."
