    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Pedata RV Center. The sales team was friendly and not pushy, which I appreciated. However, I encountered some issues with the RV after purchase that were frustrating. While they did address some of the problems, I felt the overall quality could have been better. It's a decent place to buy an RV, but be prepared for potential post-sale challenges."
