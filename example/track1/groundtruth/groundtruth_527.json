    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Aki Nom Nom Sushi & Ramen. The all-you-can-eat option is a great deal, but the quality of the sushi varied. Some rolls were fresh and delicious, while others felt a bit off. The service was decent, but the pace was slow, which made the dining experience less enjoyable. Overall, it's a decent spot for sushi, but it could use some improvements."
