    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Tampa Smiles. Dr. Redd seemed more focused on upselling me expensive procedures than addressing my actual dental needs. The office staff was unprofessional, and I felt pressured into paying for unnecessary treatments. I will not be returning and do not recommend this place to anyone."
