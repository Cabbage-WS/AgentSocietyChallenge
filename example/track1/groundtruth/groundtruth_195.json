    "review": "This Starbucks is conveniently located near the hospital, which makes it a popular spot. The service can be slow, especially during peak hours, and I've noticed that drinks are sometimes inconsistent. While the staff is generally friendly, the overall experience is just average, and I often find myself wishing for faster service."
