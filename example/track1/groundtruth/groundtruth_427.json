    "review": "I had high hopes for Tucson Strength after hearing so many positive reviews, but my experience was disappointing. The classes were overcrowded, and it was difficult to get proper attention from the trainers. The lack of space made it feel chaotic, and I didn't feel like I was getting the personalized attention I needed. I won't be returning."
