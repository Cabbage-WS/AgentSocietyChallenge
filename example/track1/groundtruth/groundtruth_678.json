    "review": "I had a decent experience at Snap Custom Pizza. The concept of customizing your own pizza is great, and the variety of toppings is impressive. However, the pizza was a bit too oily for my taste, and the service during the lunch rush could be chaotic. Overall, it's a good spot for a quick, customizable meal, but it could use some improvements in execution."
