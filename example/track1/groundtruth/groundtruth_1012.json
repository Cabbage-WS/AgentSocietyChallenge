  "review": "I visited USA Pawn & Jewelry hoping to get a fair deal on some jewelry I wanted to sell. Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming. The staff seemed uninterested and didn't offer much guidance. They made a lowball offer that didn't reflect the value of my items. I left feeling disappointed and frustrated, as it was clear they weren't willing to negotiate or provide a better offer. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a fair and professional transaction."
