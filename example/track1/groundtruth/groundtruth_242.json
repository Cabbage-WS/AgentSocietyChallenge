    "review": "I had a decent experience at Deaverdura Food Truck. The food was flavorful and had a good mix of Caribbean and Puerto Rican flavors, though it wasn't the best I've ever had. The service was quick, and the staff was friendly. Overall, it's a solid option if you're in the area and craving some authentic food truck cuisine."
