    "review": "Arepa Marketplace Latin Cafe is a hidden gem with delicious Venezuelan food. The arepas are flavorful and well-prepared, though I found the service a bit slow during peak times. The ambiance is cozy, and the staff is friendly, making it a great spot for a casual meal. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more items on the menu!"
