  "review": "ICandy has a lively atmosphere and plenty of space to move around, but it can feel a bit chaotic at times. The music is decent, and the multiple floors offer variety, though some areas feel underutilized. The staff is hit or miss, but overall, it's an okay spot for a night out with friends."
