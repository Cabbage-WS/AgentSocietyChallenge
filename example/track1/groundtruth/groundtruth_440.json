    "review": "I decided to give Ms. Jane's Cupcakes a try after hearing mixed reviews, and I'm glad I did. The cupcakes were moist and flavorful, with a nice balance of sweetness in both the cake and frosting. The Nutella cupcake was my favorite, with its rich, indulgent filling. While the prices are a bit steep, the quality justifies it. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. I'll definitely be back to try more flavors!"
