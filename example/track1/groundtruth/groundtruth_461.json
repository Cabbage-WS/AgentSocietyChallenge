    "review": "I had high hopes for Auntie Anne's, but my experience was disappointing. The pretzel I ordered was dry and overcooked, lacking the freshness I expected. The staff seemed indifferent, which made the visit even less enjoyable. While I appreciate the convenience, the quality and service need improvement."
