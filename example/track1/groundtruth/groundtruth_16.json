    "review": "Cuenelli's Peruvian Restaurant offers a unique and flavorful experience with their rotisserie chicken and authentic sides. The chicken was moist and well-seasoned, and the cilantro rice added a fresh, vibrant touch. While the atmosphere is casual, the food more than makes up for it. I'll definitely be back to try more of their Peruvian dishes!"
