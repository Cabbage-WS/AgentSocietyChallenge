    "review": "I decided to try MrBeast Burger because of the hype, but my experience was just average. The burger was decent, but the condiments overwhelmed the flavor, and the fries were a bit soggy. The staff was friendly, but the overall quality didn't quite live up to the expectations set by the brand. It's a good option for a quick meal, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
