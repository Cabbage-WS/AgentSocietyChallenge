    "review": "My experience at Northwest Medical Center was nothing short of disastrous. The staff was unprofessional, and the doctor I saw lacked any empathy or willingness to listen. I was charged exorbitant fees for minimal care, and the overall experience left me feeling frustrated and mistreated. I would strongly advise others to avoid this facility unless absolutely necessary."
