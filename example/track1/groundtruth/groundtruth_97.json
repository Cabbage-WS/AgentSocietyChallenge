    "review": "I visited China Garden for a quick lunch and found it to be an average Chinese buffet experience. The food was decent, with a decent variety, but nothing particularly stood out. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was casual, which made it a fine option for a quick meal. Overall, it's a good spot if you're in the mood for affordable Chinese food, but it's not exceptional."
