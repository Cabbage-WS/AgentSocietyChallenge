    "review": "I had a decent experience at Uncle Oogie's. The pizza was flavorful, especially the Old Italian, which had a unique and satisfying taste. The service was friendly, and the delivery was quick. While the food wasn't perfect, it was enjoyable enough to make me want to come back and try more from their menu."
