    "review": "Sullivan's Steakhouse has a great atmosphere and the food is decent, but the experience didn't quite live up to the hype. The steak was good, but not the best I've had, and the service was a bit hit or miss. The prices are on the higher side, making it more of a special occasion spot than an everyday choice. Overall, it's a solid option, but there are better steakhouses in town."
