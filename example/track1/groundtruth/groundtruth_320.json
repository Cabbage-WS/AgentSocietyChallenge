    "review": "I had a disappointing experience at Manny's Steaks & Burgers. The food was mediocre, and the service was lackluster. I ordered a cheesesteak, but it was dry and lacked flavor. Additionally, the staff seemed unorganized, and my order was mixed up. It's a shame because the concept seemed promising, but the execution fell short."
