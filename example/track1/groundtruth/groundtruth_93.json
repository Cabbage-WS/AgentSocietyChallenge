    "review": "I visited Harry's Natural Food Store hoping for a pleasant experience, but I was disappointed. The staff seemed uninterested and didn't offer any assistance, which made me feel unwelcome. While the selection of natural products is decent, the overall atmosphere was off-putting. I won't be returning anytime soon."
