  "review": "I gave \"Rumble #1\" a lukewarm rating. The premise of a scarecrow warrior god causing chaos sounds intriguing, but the execution felt a bit disjointed and the art style didn\u2019t resonate with me. It\u2019s a quick read, but it didn\u2019t leave a lasting impression, and I didn\u2019t feel compelled to explore further into the series."
