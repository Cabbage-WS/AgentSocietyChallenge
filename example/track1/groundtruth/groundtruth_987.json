    "review": "I visited Avila's Tipico Honduras Restaurante with high hopes, but my experience was mixed. The food had some authentic flavors, and the staff was friendly, but the overall atmosphere felt a bit rundown. The prices were a little steep for the setting, and the service was slower than expected. While I enjoyed some dishes, others felt underwhelming. It's worth trying for a unique experience, but it didn't fully meet my expectations."
