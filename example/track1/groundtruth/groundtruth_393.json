    "review": "Sahara Apartments exceeded my expectations! The location is perfect, close to campus and amenities, and the staff, especially Ted, were incredibly friendly and helpful. The amenities like the pool and workout room make it feel like a home away from home. I highly recommend it for students looking for a comfortable and secure place to live."
