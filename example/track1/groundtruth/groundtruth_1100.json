  "review": "I had a disappointing experience at Quebedeaux Buick GMC. The sales process was disorganized, and the staff seemed more focused on closing the deal than addressing my concerns. I felt rushed and not well-informed about the vehicle I was interested in. It left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and doubt about my purchase."
