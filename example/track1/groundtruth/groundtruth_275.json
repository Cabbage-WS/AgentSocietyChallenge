  "review": "I recently purchased the Royal Kludge RK918 mechanical keyboard, and it has certainly enhanced my gaming experience. The RGB backlighting and surrounding side lamp add a nice touch, making it visually appealing during late-night sessions. The red switches provide a smooth, quiet typing experience, and the build quality feels solid and durable. However, I wish the keys had a bit more tactile feedback. Overall, it's a great keyboard for the price."
