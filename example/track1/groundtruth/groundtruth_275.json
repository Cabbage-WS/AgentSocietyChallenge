    "review": "La Casa de Pan de Yuca offers a unique experience with its Colombian-style baked goods. The variety of yuca-based breads is impressive, and the owner is incredibly friendly. However, some items were a bit too dense for my taste, and the limited seating might not be ideal for those looking to enjoy their treats on-site. Overall, it's a good spot for adventurous eaters."
