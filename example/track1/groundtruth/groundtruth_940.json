  "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Caffe Bene. The atmosphere is cozy and perfect for studying or catching up with friends. The staff was friendly, and the Misugaru Latte I ordered was delicious, though a bit inconsistent in thickness. While the limited outlets can be a drawback, the overall experience was enjoyable."
