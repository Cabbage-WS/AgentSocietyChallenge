  "review": "Nickels Tavern is a solid neighborhood dive bar with a laid-back vibe. The cheap drinks and friendly staff make it a great spot to unwind. While it\u2019s not fancy, the casual atmosphere and occasional live music add to its charm. A bit smoky and loud, but that\u2019s part of its character."
