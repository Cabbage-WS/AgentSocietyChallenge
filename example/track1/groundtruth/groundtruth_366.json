    "review": "I decided to try Asian Fusion & Steak based on the mixed reviews, and my experience was decent but not outstanding. The sushi was fresh, but the Chinese dishes lacked depth in flavor. The delivery was prompt, which was a plus. While it’s a good option for a quick meal, it didn’t quite meet my expectations for a standout Asian fusion experience."
