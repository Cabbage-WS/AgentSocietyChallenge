  "review": "I visited Currito during a layover and decided to try their build-your-own burrito. The process was straightforward, and the staff was friendly, though a bit slow. The burrito itself was decent, with fresh ingredients, but the overall experience felt a bit underwhelming. It wasn't bad, but it didn't stand out either."
