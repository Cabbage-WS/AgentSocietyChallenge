    "review": "I decided to give Holme Style Pizza a try based on its convenient location. The pizza was decent, with a good balance of toppings, but the crust could have been better. The delivery was quick, which was a plus. Overall, it's an okay option for a quick meal, but I've had better pizza elsewhere."
