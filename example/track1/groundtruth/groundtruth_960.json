  "review": "Zivaz Mexican Bistro offers a unique twist on Mexican cuisine with fresh, flavorful dishes. I tried the Asada burger, which lived up to its \"Best Burger in Tucson\" title, and the Chile Relleno added a delightful kick. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was casual yet trendy. A great spot for a quick, satisfying meal!"
