    "review": "I had an excellent experience at Brooklyn Bedding. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and patient, allowing me to try out several mattresses without feeling pressured. The mattress I chose has significantly improved my sleep quality, and the delivery process was smooth and efficient. I highly recommend this store for anyone in need of a new mattress."
