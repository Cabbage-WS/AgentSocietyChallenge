  "review": "This McDonald's is by far the worst I've ever experienced. The place was filthy, the staff was unhelpful, and the food was subpar. I had to wait in a long line, only to be served cold fries and a stale burger. The overall atmosphere was chaotic and uninviting. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone."
