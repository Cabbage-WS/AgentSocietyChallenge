    "review": "Fiso Lounge has an interesting setup with multiple floors and a rooftop, which is a nice touch for a night out. The music was decent, and the crowd was lively, but the mandatory coat check and the slightly overpriced drinks were a bit of a downside. Overall, it’s a decent spot for a fun night, but it didn’t quite live up to the hype for me."
