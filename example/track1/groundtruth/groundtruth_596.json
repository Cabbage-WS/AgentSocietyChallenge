    "review": "I visited Circ during a recent stay at the Marriott Downtown. The atmosphere was pleasant, with comfortable seating and a classy vibe. However, the drinks were a bit overpriced, and the service felt inconsistent. While the bartender was friendly, the overall experience didn't quite meet my expectations for a hotel bar."
