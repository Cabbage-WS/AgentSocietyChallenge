    "review": "This Taco Bell location is by far the worst I've ever experienced. The service is painfully slow, the staff is unfriendly, and the food is consistently incorrect and cold. I waited over 30 minutes for an order that was completely wrong, and the drive-thru experience was chaotic. I won't be returning, and I strongly advise others to avoid this location."
