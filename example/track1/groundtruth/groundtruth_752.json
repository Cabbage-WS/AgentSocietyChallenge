    "review": "The Boilermaker offers a unique and cozy atmosphere with its candlelit ambiance and rustic decor. The extensive beer selection is impressive, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. While the food menu is limited, the hot dogs and fries are worth trying. A great spot for beer enthusiasts and those looking for a chill night out."
