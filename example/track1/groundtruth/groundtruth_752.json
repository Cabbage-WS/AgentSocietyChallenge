  "review": "\"Someone's Come to Our House\" is a delightful and gentle book that celebrates the joy of welcoming a new baby into a family. The poetic text and warm illustrations capture the essence of love and anticipation. While it may not have the depth of some other children's books, it's a sweet and comforting read for young children and their families."
