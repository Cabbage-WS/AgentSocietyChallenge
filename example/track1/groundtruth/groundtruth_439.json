  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"My Town\" offers a delightful glimpse into the life of a small town through the eyes of a young boy named Ted. The fold-out pages and cross-sections of buildings are engaging and educational, making it an excellent introduction to geography and community for young readers. While not as visually stunning as some of the graphic novels I've read, it serves its purpose well and is a valuable addition to a child's library."
