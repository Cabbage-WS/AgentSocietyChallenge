    "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Echo Nails & Spa. The staff was friendly, and the salon was clean and inviting. My gel manicure lasted longer than expected, which was a nice surprise. However, the price felt a bit steep compared to other salons in the area. Overall, it was a good visit, and I might return for another service."
