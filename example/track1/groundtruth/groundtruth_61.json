    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Hyde Park Dental. The staff was friendly and the office was clean, but the appointment scheduling was a bit chaotic. I had to reschedule twice due to last-minute cancellations, which was frustrating. The actual dental work was fine, but the overall process left me feeling a bit disappointed."
