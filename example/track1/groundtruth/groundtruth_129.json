  "review": "The Moukey USB 3.0 Audio Interface is a solid choice for beginners and casual users looking for a reliable and easy-to-use device. The 48kHz/24-bit recording quality is impressive for its price point, and the phantom power feature is a plus for those using condenser microphones. It's compact and portable, making it perfect for on-the-go recording sessions."
