    "review": "Insomnia Cookies is a great spot for a late-night treat, especially when you're craving something sweet and comforting. The cookies are warm, gooey, and absolutely delicious, with flavors like s'mores and triple chocolate chunk being standout options. While the staff could be a bit more engaging, the quality of the cookies more than makes up for it. Perfect for satisfying those midnight cravings!"
