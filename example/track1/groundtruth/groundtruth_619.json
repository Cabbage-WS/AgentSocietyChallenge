    "review": "The Courtyard by Marriott is a decent option for a stay near Philly, with modern amenities and comfortable beds. However, the housekeeping could be more consistent, as I encountered issues with cleanliness and missing supplies during my stay. The location is convenient, but the overall experience didn't quite meet my expectations for a Marriott property."
