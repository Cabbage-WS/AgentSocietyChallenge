  "review": "Imperial Inn offers a decent dim sum experience, but it feels a bit outdated. The food is hit or miss, with some dishes being quite flavorful while others are underwhelming. The service can be inconsistent, but the atmosphere is lively and authentic. Overall, it's a good spot for a casual meal, though it might not impress everyone."
