    "review": "I had high hopes for California Tacos To Go based on the reviews, but my experience was disappointing. The tacos were bland, and the service felt rushed. I ordered the grouper taco, which was supposed to be their specialty, but it lacked flavor and was overly breaded. The staff was friendly, but the overall quality didn't meet my expectations. I won't be rushing back."
