    "review": "The Hub on Chestnut is a prime example of poor management and lack of accountability. Despite my efforts to resolve issues, they were unresponsive and dismissive. The lack of professionalism in handling tenant concerns is unacceptable, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere."
