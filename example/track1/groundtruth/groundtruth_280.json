    "review": "I visited Wendy's hoping for a quick and satisfying meal, but my experience was disappointing. The food was lukewarm, and the service felt rushed and unorganized. While the staff was polite, the overall quality didn't meet my expectations for a fast-food restaurant. I hope they can improve their consistency in the future."
