    "review": "I had the pleasure of trying BBQ4U's tri-tip recently, and it was absolutely phenomenal! The meat was tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The smoky aroma was irresistible, and the portion size was generous. Bill and Sue were friendly and professional, making the experience even better. I'll definitely be back for more!"
