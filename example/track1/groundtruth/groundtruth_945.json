    "review": "Frogs Organic Bakery has a charming atmosphere and some delicious pastries, but the overall experience left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. The service was slow, and the prices felt a bit steep for what was offered. While the almond croissant was fantastic, the rest of the menu didn't quite live up to the hype."
