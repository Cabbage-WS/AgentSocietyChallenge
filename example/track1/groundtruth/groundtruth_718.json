    "review": "I decided to give Bella T's Pizza a try after hearing about the new management. The pizza was decent, with a crispy crust and decent toppings, but it lacked the wow factor I was hoping for. The service was friendly, but the overall experience felt a bit underwhelming. I might give it another shot, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon."
