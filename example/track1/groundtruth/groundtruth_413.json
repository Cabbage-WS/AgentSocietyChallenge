  "review": "\"The Carnival Ghost\" offers a thrilling ride through the eerie atmosphere of a traveling carnival, with the Sweet Valley Twins at the heart of the mystery. While the plot is engaging and suitable for younger readers, the character development and pacing could be more robust. It's a fun, quick read that captures the essence of the series."
