  "review": "This Adjustable Height Neck Caul is a solid investment for any guitarist or luthier looking to maintain or repair their instruments. The adjustable feet and felt-lined surface make it easy to support the neck without causing any damage. While it's a bit pricey, the quality and stability of the tool justify the cost."
