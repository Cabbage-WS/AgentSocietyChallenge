    "review": "I had a delightful experience at Hey Giant! Little Biscuits. The mini biscuits are a fun twist, and the flavors I tried were absolutely delicious. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. While the biscuits are small, they pack a flavorful punch and are perfect for trying multiple varieties. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to explore more of their creative combinations!"
