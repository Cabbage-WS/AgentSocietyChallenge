    "review": "The Gold Club has a divey, no-frills vibe that feels authentic, but the overall experience left me underwhelmed. The dancers were hit or miss, and the small space made it feel cramped. While the laid-back atmosphere was somewhat enjoyable, it didnâ€™t quite live up to my expectations for a night out."
