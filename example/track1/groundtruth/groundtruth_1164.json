  "review": "I had high hopes for Wholly Smoke Bar-B Que based on the reviews, but my experience was just average. The ribs were flavorful but a bit dry, and the sides were nothing special. The atmosphere was casual, which I liked, but the service was a bit slow. I might give it another try, but there are other BBQ places I prefer in the area."
