    "review": "Pier 1 has a great selection of home decor and furniture, but my experience was mixed. The staff was friendly, but the store felt a bit cluttered and disorganized. I found some cute items, but the pricing felt a bit high for what it was. Overall, it's a decent place to browse, but I might shop elsewhere for better value."
