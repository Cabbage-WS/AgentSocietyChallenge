    "review": "I had high hopes for Takka Grill and Pizza based on some of the reviews, but my experience was disappointing. The pizza was overly cheesy, and the toppings were sparse, which was a letdown. The service was slow, and the overall vibe felt uninviting. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."
