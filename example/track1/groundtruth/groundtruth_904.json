    "review": "Town Food Market is a convenient spot for late-night beer runs, but it's not without its quirks. The selection is decent, and the fact that it's open until 2 AM is a lifesaver. However, the prices are a bit steep, and the lack of clear pricing on items can be frustrating. Still, it's a reliable option for those in need of a quick fix."
