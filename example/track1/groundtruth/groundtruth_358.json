    "review": "I had high hopes for this Panda Express, but my experience was disappointing. The food was mediocre, and the service felt rushed. I ordered the orange chicken, but it was overcooked and lacked flavor. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and the dining area wasn't well-maintained. I expected better from a chain I usually enjoy."
