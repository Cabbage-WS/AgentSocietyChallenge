  "review": "I recently purchased the Pro-LifT T-9456 Grey Scissor Jack and have been thoroughly impressed. The extra wide base provides excellent stability, and the lifting range from 3-3/4 inches to 15-1/8 inches is perfect for my needs. It's lightweight and compact, making it easy to store and transport."
