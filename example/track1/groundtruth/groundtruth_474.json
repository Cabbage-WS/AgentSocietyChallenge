    "review": "I had high hopes for Yogomisu after hearing about their crepes and frozen yogurt, but my experience was disappointing. The frozen yogurt was overly tart and had an unpleasant texture, and the toppings bar was not well-maintained. The staff seemed uninterested and inattentive, which made the whole visit feel awkward. I won't be returning."
