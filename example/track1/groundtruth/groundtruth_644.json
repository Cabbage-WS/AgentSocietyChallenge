    "review": "I had a terrible experience at McLeod's Auto Service. They failed to fix my car's issue after multiple visits, and I ended up having to take it to another mechanic who diagnosed and repaired the problem correctly. Their lack of communication and inability to resolve the issue left me frustrated and disappointed."
