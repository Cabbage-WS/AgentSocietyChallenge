    "review": "The Wayward offers a delightful dining experience with its charming ambiance and thoughtful menu. The outdoor seating area is cozy, and the food is well-prepared, especially the corn beignets and oysters. While the service was a bit slow, the overall vibe and quality of the dishes make it worth a return visit."
