    "review": "I attended Chef Joseph Poon's cooking class, and while it was an interesting experience, it didn't fully meet my expectations. The class was informative, and Chef Poon's enthusiasm was evident, but the overall vibe felt a bit chaotic. The food we prepared was decent, though not exceptional. It was a fun outing, but I wouldn't say it was worth the price tag for the value received."
