    "review": "I visited Baskin-Robbins on Speedway Blvd, and while the ice cream flavors were decent, the overall experience left something to be desired. The staff was friendly, but the place felt outdated and could use a refresh. I enjoyed my scoop of Mint Chocolate Chip, but the ambiance and cleanliness could be improved."
