  "review": "\"Pictograms From The Interior Of B.C\" is a captivating collection of poetry that vividly captures the essence of the landscapes and cultures of British Columbia. The concise yet powerful imagery in each poem draws the reader into a world that is both mysterious and beautifully rendered. I particularly enjoyed the way the poet integrates local history and natural elements, making each piece a small journey in itself."
