  "review": "I had high hopes for Woodland Village Restaurant based on some of my past experiences, but this visit was disappointing. The food was mediocre at best, and the overall atmosphere felt run-down. While the staff was friendly, the quality of the meal didn't match my expectations. I might give it another try for takeout, but I wouldn't recommend dining in."
