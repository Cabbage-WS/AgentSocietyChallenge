    "review": "I decided to try Pete's Famous Pizza Restaurant after hearing mixed reviews, and my experience was just average. The pizza was decent, but the crust was a bit too thick for my taste. The service was friendly, but the overall quality didn't stand out. It's a good option for a quick meal, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
