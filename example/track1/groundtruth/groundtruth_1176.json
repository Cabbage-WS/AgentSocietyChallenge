  "review": "This Chick-fil-A location has been consistently disappointing. The drive-thru wait times are unacceptably long, and the service is slow and disorganized. On top of that, my order was incorrect, which added to the frustration. I expected better from Chick-fil-A, but this location falls far short of the usual standards."
