    "review": "Writer's Block Rehab is a unique and cozy spot with a creative cocktail menu. The library-themed decor is charming, and the drinks are well-crafted, though a bit pricey. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere is perfect for a quiet drink with friends. I'll definitely return to explore more of their inventive cocktails."
