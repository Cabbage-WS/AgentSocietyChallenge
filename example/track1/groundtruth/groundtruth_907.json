    "review": "I had high hopes for Cafe Bonita given its location and the Mexican food scene in Tucson, but my experience was underwhelming. The food lacked depth in flavor, and the service was slow and unattentive. While the outdoor seating was a nice touch, it wasn't enough to make up for the overall mediocrity. I wouldn't rush back, especially with so many better options in the area."
