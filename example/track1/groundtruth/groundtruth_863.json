    "review": "I enjoyed my visit to Sauce Pizza & Wine. The thin-crust pizza was delicious, and the salads were fresh and flavorful. The service was quick and friendly, making it a great spot for a casual meal. While it’s not the most upscale experience, it’s perfect for a quick, satisfying bite."
