    "review": "I had high expectations for Zento based on the reviews, but my experience was just average. The sushi was decent, but nothing extraordinary. The service was friendly, but the pace was slow, which made the meal feel drawn out. Overall, it's a good spot, but there are better sushi options in Philly."
