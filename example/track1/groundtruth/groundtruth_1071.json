  "review": "I visited DSW hoping to find a good pair of shoes, but the selection was a bit disappointing. The store layout is nice, and the staff was friendly, but I struggled to find shoes in my size. The clearance section had some decent options, but overall, it wasn't a great shopping experience for me."
