    "review": "I decided to give PaniniRiffic a try based on the mixed reviews, and my experience was decent but not outstanding. The Ybanini was flavorful, but the sandwich was a bit greasy, which was disappointing. The seasoned fries, however, were a pleasant surpriseâ€”crispy and well-seasoned. Overall, it's an okay option for a quick bite, but I wouldn't rush back for more."
