  "review": "The Evans Hydraulic Red Rock Pack exceeded my expectations. The sound is rich and deep, just as described, and the ease of tuning is a huge plus for someone who isn't a professional drummer. The quality and durability of the drumheads are top-notch, making them a great investment for any drummer."
