    "review": "Pita Chip exceeded my expectations with its fresh, flavorful Mediterranean cuisine. The customizable options allowed me to create a delicious bowl with chicken shawarma, fresh veggies, and their amazing garlic sauce. The service was quick, and the staff was friendly, making it a perfect spot for a satisfying meal. I'll definitely be back!"
