    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Tire Kingdom. They tried to upsell me on unnecessary repairs and were unprofessional throughout the process. The service was slow, and the staff seemed more interested in making a quick buck than providing quality care for my vehicle. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
