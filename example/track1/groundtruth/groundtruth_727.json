    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Plush Nails & Spa. The salon was clean and the staff was friendly, but my gel manicure started chipping within a few days, which was disappointing. The massage chairs were a nice touch, but the quality of the service didn't quite meet my expectations for the price."
