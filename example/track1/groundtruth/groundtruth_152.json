  "review": "I've been using this concentrated cleaner for a few weeks now, and it's been a great addition to my cleaning routine. It's effective on tough stains and doesn't leave any harmful residue, which is a big plus. The only downside is the price, which is a bit steep, but the product's performance and the fact that it's non-toxic and environmentally friendly make it worth the investment."
