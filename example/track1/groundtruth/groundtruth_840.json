    "review": "This Burger King location is a complete disaster. The service is painfully slow, and the staff seems completely disorganized. On my last visit, they messed up my order and forgot basic items like utensils. The dining area was dirty, and the overall experience was far from what you'd expect from a fast food chain. I won't be returning anytime soon."
