    "review": "China Wok offers solid, affordable Chinese food with quick service. The sesame chicken was flavorful and not overly greasy, while the pork fried rice was well-seasoned. While it’s not the most authentic experience, it’s a reliable spot for a quick, satisfying meal. Cash-only is a minor inconvenience, but the quality and speed make it worth it."
