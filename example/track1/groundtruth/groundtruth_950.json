    "review": "I had high hopes for El Pollo Loco, but my experience was disappointing. The chicken was dry and overcooked, which is a major letdown for a place known for its grilled chicken. The sides were decent, but the main dish was underwhelming. I might give it another try, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon."
