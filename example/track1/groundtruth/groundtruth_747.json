    "review": "I absolutely loved my experience at Famous 4th Street Cookie! The cookies are soft, flavorful, and perfectly baked. I tried the walnut chocolate chip and the snickerdoodle, and both were amazing. The staff was friendly and made the visit even more enjoyable. Highly recommend this place for anyone with a sweet tooth!"
