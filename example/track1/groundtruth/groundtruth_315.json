    "review": "I had a mixed experience with National Bank of Arizona. While the staff was polite, the overall service felt impersonal and lacked the small-town charm they advertise. I encountered a minor issue with a transaction that took longer than expected to resolve, and the lack of proactive communication was frustrating. It's not the worst bank, but it didn't live up to my expectations either."
