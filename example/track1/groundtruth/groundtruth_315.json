  "review": "The TopStage Universal Drum & Keyboard Throne Stool JX95 is a decent option for a basic stool, with a comfortable padded seat and a sturdy build. However, the lack of an adjustable height mechanism is a significant drawback, as it limits the stool's versatility and comfort for different users. It's a solid choice if you don't need height adjustment, but it falls short for those who do."
