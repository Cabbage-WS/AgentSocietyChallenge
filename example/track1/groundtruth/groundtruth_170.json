    "review": "The Humane Society of Tampa Bay has a great mission, but my experience was mixed. The staff was friendly, and the facility was clean, but the long wait times and occasional miscommunication were frustrating. Overall, it's a good place for adoption, but be prepared for a bit of a wait."
