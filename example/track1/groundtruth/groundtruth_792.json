    "review": "I had high hopes for Campus Pizza Restaurant, but my experience was disappointing. The pizza I ordered was bland and lacked flavor, with minimal toppings that didn't justify the price. The service was also slow, and the overall atmosphere felt uninviting. I wouldn't recommend this place unless significant improvements are made."
