    "review": "Mariscos Chihuahua offers a unique twist on Mexican seafood, and the food was quite enjoyable. I tried the shrimp culichi, which had a rich, creamy sauce that was delicious. The service was friendly, but the ambiance could use a bit of improvement. Overall, it's a solid choice for seafood lovers looking for something different."
