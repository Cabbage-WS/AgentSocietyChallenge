    "review": "I had a positive experience at Walmart Vision & Glasses. The staff was friendly and efficient, and they helped me find a great pair of frames within my budget. The eye exam was thorough and professional. While the process was smooth, I did notice a slight delay in getting my glasses, which was a bit inconvenient. Overall, Iâ€™m satisfied with the service and would recommend it to others."
