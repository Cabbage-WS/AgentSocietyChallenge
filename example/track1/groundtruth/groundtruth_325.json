    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Luxury Auto Mall. They promised me a car that didn't even exist, and when I confronted them, they tried to push another overpriced, unreliable vehicle on me. Their lack of transparency and unethical practices are appalling. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
