    "review": "Cavanaugh's is a decent spot for a casual night out, especially if you're looking to watch a game. The wings were tasty, and the atmosphere was lively, though it can get a bit crowded and loud. Service was hit-or-miss, but overall, it's a good place for a quick bite and a drink with friends."
