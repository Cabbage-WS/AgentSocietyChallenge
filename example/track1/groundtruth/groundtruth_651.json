    "review": "I had a great experience at Opa! Time Gyros and Chopped Salads. The gyro was flavorful and the portions were generous, which I really appreciated. The staff was friendly and efficient, making the overall experience enjoyable. While the location is a bit out of the way, the quality of the food makes it worth the trip."
