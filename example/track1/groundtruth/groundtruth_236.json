    "review": "I had high hopes for Mary Jo's Performing Arts Academy, but my experience was disappointing. The waiting area is cramped and uncomfortable, and the lack of communication about class schedules was frustrating. While the teachers seem nice, the overall organization and facilities need significant improvement."
