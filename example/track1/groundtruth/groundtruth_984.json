  "review": "Banjara Indian Bistro offers a delightful dining experience with flavorful dishes and a cozy atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan, which were both cooked to perfection. The service was attentive, and the BYOB option made the meal even more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to try authentic Indian cuisine."
