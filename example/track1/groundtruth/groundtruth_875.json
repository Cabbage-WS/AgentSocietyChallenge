    "review": "This Wendy's location is a prime example of why fast food chains can be so hit or miss. The food was mediocre at best, with cold fries and a burger that lacked flavor. The service was slow, and the staff seemed uninterested in being there. It's a shame because the concept is great, but the execution here falls flat. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."
