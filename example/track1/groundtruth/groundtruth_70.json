    "review": "Rizzo Ice Rink offers a fun and affordable skating experience, especially for families and kids. The $4 skate rentals are a great deal, and the atmosphere is lively and enjoyable. While the ice isn't perfect and the location is a bit underwhelming, it's a great spot for casual skaters looking for a good time without breaking the bank."
