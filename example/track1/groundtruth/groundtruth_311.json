    "review": "I had high hopes for Chuy's, but my experience was underwhelming. The food lacked flavor, and the service was slow despite the restaurant not being busy. The atmosphere was casual, but the overall experience didn't live up to my expectations. I might give it another try, but I was disappointed this time."
