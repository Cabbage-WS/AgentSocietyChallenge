    "review": "The Holiday Inn Express near Busch Gardens had some positives, like its convenient location and friendly staff, but overall, the experience was disappointing. The room was clean enough, but the hotel itself felt outdated and the hallway was noticeably dirty. The constant noise from nearby emergency vehicles made it hard to sleep, which really impacted my stay. I expected better from a Holiday Inn Express, but this one fell short."
