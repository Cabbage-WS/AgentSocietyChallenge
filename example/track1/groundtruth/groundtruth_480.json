    "review": "I had a terrible experience at LoCicero Medical Group. The wait times are absurd, and the staff is unprofessional and rude. I waited over two hours for a simple appointment, and the doctor seemed disinterested and rushed. This place is disorganized and lacks any sense of care for their patients. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
