    "review": "I visited New Acropolis Restaurant hoping for a decent meal, but I was disappointed. The food was mediocre, and the service was slow despite the place not being busy. The atmosphere felt outdated, and the overall experience just wasn't worth the trip. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in a pinch."
