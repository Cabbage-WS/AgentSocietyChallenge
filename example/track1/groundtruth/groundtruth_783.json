    "review": "This McDonald's is a complete disaster. The drive-thru took forever, and when I finally got my food, it was cold and incorrect. The staff seemed unbothered and unprofessional. I've had better experiences at other McDonald's locations, but this one is a total letdown. Avoid it if you can."
