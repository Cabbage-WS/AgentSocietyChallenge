    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Crabby Cafe and Sports Bar. The food was decent, but the service was slow and inconsistent. The outdoor seating and atmosphere were nice, but the overall experience left me feeling underwhelmed. I might give it another try, but there are definitely areas that need improvement."
