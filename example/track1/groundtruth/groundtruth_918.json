  "review": "The food at Westshore Pizza was decent, but the service was disappointing. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak and pizza, and while the flavors were okay, the sandwiches were cold and lacked proper preparation. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and the wait time was unreasonably long. I wouldn't rush back, especially with so many other options in the area."
