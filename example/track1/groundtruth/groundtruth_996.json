    "review": "I had a great experience at Fresh Kitchen New Tampa! The food was fresh and flavorful, and the customizable bowls made it easy to create a meal that suited my tastes. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming. While the portions were a bit small for the price, the quality made up for it. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!"
