    "review": "I visited Kwality Fusion for their lunch buffet, hoping to enjoy a variety of flavorful Indian dishes. While the selection was decent, I found the dishes to be somewhat underwhelming in terms of taste and texture. The staff was friendly, but the overall experience didn't quite meet my expectations. I appreciate the effort, but the quality of the food needs improvement."
