    "review": "The Flycatcher offers a laid-back and eclectic atmosphere that feels like a hidden gem on 4th Avenue. The drinks are reasonably priced, and the outdoor patio adds a nice touch for those who want to escape the noise. While the service can be hit or miss, the overall vibe makes it worth visiting, especially for live music or karaoke nights."
