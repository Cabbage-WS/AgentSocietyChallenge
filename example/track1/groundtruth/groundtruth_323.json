    "review": "I stopped by Brick And Bell on a whim and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their coffee and pastries. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy, though the lack of signage made it a bit tricky to find. The coffee was smooth and flavorful, and the scone I had was freshly baked and delicious. Iâ€™ll definitely be back for more!"
