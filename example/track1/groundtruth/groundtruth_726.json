    "review": "I visited Kyoto Japan for a quick lunch and ordered the chicken teriyaki. The food was decent, but nothing extraordinary. The portion was generous, and the price was reasonable, but the taste was somewhat bland. The service was quick, but the overall experience felt more like fast food than a sit-down restaurant. It’s a good option for a quick bite, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it."
