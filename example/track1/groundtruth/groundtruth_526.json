    "review": "I had a great time at PHS Pop Up Garden - East Passyunk! The atmosphere is lively and welcoming, with plenty of seating and a nice selection of drinks. The staff was friendly, and the overall vibe made it a perfect spot to relax with friends. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more of the menu!"
