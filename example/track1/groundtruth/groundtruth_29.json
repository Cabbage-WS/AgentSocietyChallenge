    "review": "Vale Food Co offers a decent selection of healthy options, but the experience can be hit or miss. The food is fresh, but some items lack flavor and the portions can be inconsistent. The staff is friendly, but the ordering process can be confusing. Overall, it's a good spot for a quick, healthy meal, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype."
