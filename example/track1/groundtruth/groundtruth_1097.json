  "review": "I decided to try Furfari Soft Pretzel Bakery based on the mixed reviews, and my experience was decent. The pretzels were fresh and had a good flavor, but they were a bit cold when I received them, which was disappointing. The staff was friendly, and the price was reasonable. I might come back, but I hope they improve the temperature of their pretzels."
