    "review": "I had a great experience at Industrious Avenue of the Arts. The space is modern, clean, and well-organized, which made my workday much more enjoyable. The staff, especially Ariel, were incredibly helpful and welcoming. While the experience was mostly positive, I did notice some minor logistical issues during my visit, which is why I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, it’s a fantastic co-working space with a great community vibe."
