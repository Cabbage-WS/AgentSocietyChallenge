    "review": "I decided to try A Cup of Tea after hearing about their unique milk foam teas. I ordered the Blueberry Tea with Milk Foam, and it was a refreshing and flavorful experience. The milk foam added a creamy, slightly salty layer that complemented the fresh blueberry flavor perfectly. While the service was a bit slow, the quality of the drink made up for it. I'll definitely be back to explore more of their menu."
