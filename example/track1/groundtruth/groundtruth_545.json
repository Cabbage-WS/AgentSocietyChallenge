    "review": "La Mia Toscana has a nice atmosphere and the service was friendly, but the food didn't quite meet my expectations. The pasta was decent, but the flavors felt a bit underwhelming compared to other Italian restaurants I've tried. I might give it another shot, but it wasn't the standout experience I was hoping for."
