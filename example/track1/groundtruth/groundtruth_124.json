    "review": "I had an amazing experience at Legacy Tattoo! The staff was friendly and professional, and the shop was clean and welcoming. My tattoo artist, Josh Franklin, was incredibly talented and patient with my ideas. The entire process was smooth, and I couldn't be happier with the results. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for quality tattoo work."
