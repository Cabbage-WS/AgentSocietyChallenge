  "review": "The book's premise of Catalan anarchists kidnapping a British diplomat is intriguing and offers a unique historical perspective. However, the execution feels a bit flat and the characters could have been more developed. It's a quick read and provides some interesting insights into the anarchist movement, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations."
