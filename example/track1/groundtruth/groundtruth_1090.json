  "review": "The Hilton Tampa Downtown had a nice lobby and friendly staff, but the room was disappointing. The bathroom was tiny, and the A/C didn\u2019t work well, leaving the room uncomfortably warm. For the price, I expected more, and I wouldn\u2019t stay here again unless improvements are made."
