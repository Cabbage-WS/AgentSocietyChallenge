    "review": "I had a terrible experience at this McDonald's. The staff was incredibly rude, and they messed up my order multiple times. I specifically asked for no pickles on my burger, but it came loaded with them. When I tried to explain the mistake, the employee just shrugged and said, \"That's how we make it.\" I won't be coming back here again."
