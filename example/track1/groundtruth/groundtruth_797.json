    "review": "I visited Hair Outlet Beauty Supply to browse their selection of wigs and hair extensions. The store had a wide variety of products, which was impressive. However, I felt the staff could have been more attentive and helpful. Overall, it was an average experience, but I might return if I need more products in the future."
