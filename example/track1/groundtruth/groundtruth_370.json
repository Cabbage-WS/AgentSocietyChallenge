    "review": "I had a great time at Million’s Crab Boiled Seafood! The variety of seafood options was impressive, and the Million Sauce added a nice kick to the meal. The service was attentive, and the atmosphere was lively. While the prices were a bit steep, the quality of the seafood made it worth it. I’d definitely come back for another seafood feast!"
