  "review": "The Preserve Golf Club offers a stunning setting with breathtaking views of the Santa Catalina Mountains. The course is well-maintained, and the facilities are impressive. However, the pace of play can be slow, and the service at the pro shop could be more welcoming. Overall, it's a great value for the experience, but improvements in customer service would make it even better."
