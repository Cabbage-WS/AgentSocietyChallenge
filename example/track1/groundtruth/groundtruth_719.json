    "review": "I decided to try EVOS for a healthier fast food option, but I was a bit underwhelmed. The air-baked fries were decent, but the burger lacked flavor and felt a bit bland. The concept is great, but the execution didn't quite meet my expectations. I might give it another try, but I hope the next experience is better."
