    "review": "I really enjoyed my visit to Empanadas & Arepas Factory! The empanadas were crispy and flavorful, and the variety of fillings was impressive. The outdoor seating area was a nice touch, especially on a sunny day. My only suggestion would be to add a bit more seasoning to the meat fillings to enhance the overall taste. Overall, a great spot for a quick, tasty bite!"
