    "review": "I had a terrible experience with Nelson J. Greer Painting Contractors. They were unprofessional and left paint splatters all over my furniture and floors. When I brought it up, they were dismissive and rude, blaming me for not moving my belongings. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
