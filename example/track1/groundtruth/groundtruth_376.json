  "review": "I found the ETOPLIGHTING 10 LED Super Bright Lamp to be a useful addition to my setup. It provides ample light and the clip-on design is versatile, fitting securely on my music stand without causing any damage. While the battery life is decent, the inclusion of a USB option for power is a welcome feature, although I wish the batteries were rechargeable for added convenience."
