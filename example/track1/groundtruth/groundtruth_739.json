    "review": "I recently tried Potbelly Sandwich Shop for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sandwiches. The Mediterranean sandwich was my favorite, packed with flavor and perfectly toasted. The staff was friendly, and the ordering process was smooth. While it didn't quite blow me away, it's definitely a solid option for a quick, tasty meal."
