    "review": "I absolutely love Mr. Wish! The bubble tea here is top-notch, with fresh ingredients and a variety of flavors to choose from. I tried the classic fruit tea with boba, and it was refreshing and delicious. The staff is friendly, and the place is clean and welcoming. Highly recommend this spot for a quick and satisfying drink!"
