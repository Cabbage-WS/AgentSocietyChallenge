  "review": "I had mixed feelings about my experience at Soul D'lysh & Catering. The food was decent, but not exceptional, and some items felt like they lacked freshness or seasoning. The service was hit or miss, with communication issues and delays. While I appreciate the effort, there's definitely room for improvement to match the positive reviews others have shared."
