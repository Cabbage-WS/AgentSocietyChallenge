    "review": "Frogury is a solid spot for frozen yogurt and boba tea. The taro flavor yogurt is particularly delicious, and the boba tea options are well-made and satisfying. The staff is friendly, and the self-serve setup allows for plenty of customization. While the topping selection could be a bit fresher, the overall experience is enjoyable and worth a visit."
