    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Collision Care Auto Body Centers. The staff was friendly and kept me updated, which I appreciated. However, the repair took longer than expected, and there were some minor issues with the final result. While the overall service was decent, it didn't quite meet my expectations based on the positive reviews."
