    "review": "I had mixed feelings about CrÃªpe Town. The crepes were decent, but not exceptional. The fillings were fresh, but the overall flavor didn't quite live up to my expectations. The service was friendly, but the lack of a restroom was inconvenient. It's a good option for a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."
