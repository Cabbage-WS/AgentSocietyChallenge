  "review": "I had high hopes for Bella Locs after hearing about their reputation, but my experience was disappointing. The service was rushed, and the quality of the hair didn't meet my expectations. I felt like my concerns were brushed off, which left me feeling undervalued as a customer. I wish I had better news to share, but I can't recommend this place based on my experience."
