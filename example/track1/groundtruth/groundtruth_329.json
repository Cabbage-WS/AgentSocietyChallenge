    "review": "I had a disappointing experience at Hyde Park Tan Lounge. The staff was unprofessional, and I encountered billing issues similar to other reviews. Despite the nice facilities, the poor customer service and lack of accountability left me feeling frustrated. I wouldn't recommend this place due to the unresolved issues and lack of care for customer satisfaction."
