    "review": "Barra Rossa Ristorante offers a pleasant dining experience with a cozy atmosphere and decent Italian fare. The service was attentive, and the food, particularly the gluten-free pizza, was flavorful and satisfying. While it may not be the most exceptional Italian restaurant in Philly, itâ€™s a solid choice for a casual meal."
