  "review": "I had a terrible experience at Childrens Orthopedic Specialists. The staff was unhelpful and disorganized, and it took forever to get an appointment despite my child needing urgent care. The doctor seemed rushed and didn't explain anything clearly. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
