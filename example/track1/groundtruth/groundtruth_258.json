    "review": "I had a great time exploring Fish Hawk Spirits! The tasting experience was informative and enjoyable, with a variety of unique spirits to try. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, making the visit even more pleasant. While the prices were on the higher side, the quality of the products made it worth it. Iâ€™d definitely recommend stopping by for a tasting!"
