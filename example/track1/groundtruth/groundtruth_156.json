  "review": "The assortment of small hairpin cotter pins is quite useful for various projects and repairs. The quality of the pins seems good, and the zinc plating should help with corrosion resistance. However, I wish there were more detailed instructions or a size chart included in the package for easier identification of the right pin for the job."
