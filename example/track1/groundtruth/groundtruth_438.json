    "review": "I had a solid experience at Brooklyn Bedding. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, especially Janine, who made the process smooth and stress-free. The mattresses were well-made and reasonably priced, though I didn't find anything that completely blew me away. Overall, it was a good visit, and Iâ€™d recommend it to others looking for a new mattress."
