    "review": "I visited Posh Nails & Spa for a manicure and pedicure, and while the staff was friendly and the salon was clean, the experience wasn't quite up to my expectations. The service was a bit rushed, and I didn't feel like my preferences were fully considered. However, the overall atmosphere was pleasant, and the prices were reasonable. It's a decent spot, but I might try somewhere else next time for a more personalized experience."
