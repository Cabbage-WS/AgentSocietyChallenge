    "review": "First Watch is a solid choice for a healthy and fresh breakfast. The menu offers a variety of options, and the food is consistently good. While the service can be a bit slow during peak times, the quality of the meals makes up for it. I especially enjoyed the avocado toast and the seasonal pancakes."
