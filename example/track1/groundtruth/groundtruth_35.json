    "review": "I had a solid experience at Eliz Mexican Restaurant & American Breakfast. The food was fresh and flavorful, especially the homemade tortillas and guacamole. The service was friendly, though a bit slow during peak times. Overall, it's a great spot for a casual meal with a mix of Mexican and American options."
