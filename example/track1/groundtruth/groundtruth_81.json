    "review": "I had a terrible experience with Avis. The staff was unhelpful and the car I rented had issues with the gas gauge, similar to what others have mentioned. They tried to charge me extra for gas despite returning the car at the same level I received it. This kind of dishonest behavior is unacceptable and has left me with a very negative impression of this location."
