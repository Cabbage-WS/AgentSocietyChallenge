    "review": "I had an amazing experience at Bagels & Co! The bagels were fresh and chewy, just the way I like them. The cream cheese selection was impressive, and I especially enjoyed the jalape√±o cheddar flavor. The staff was friendly and efficient, making the whole experience enjoyable. Highly recommend this place for a great breakfast or snack!"
