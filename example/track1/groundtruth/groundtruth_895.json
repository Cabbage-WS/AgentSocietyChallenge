    "review": "Nakaya Japanese Bistro offers a cozy and authentic Japanese dining experience. The ramen was flavorful, though a bit on the salty side, and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The service was friendly and attentive, making the overall visit enjoyable. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more dishes!"
