    "review": "Hot Wax Coffee Shop is a hidden gem in Ybor City! The atmosphere is chill, the staff is super friendly, and the variety of drinks (coffee, kratom, kava) is impressive. I especially loved the open mic night, which had a great vibe and supportive crowd. Definitely a must-visit spot for both locals and visitors!"
