  "review": "\"Where Do Diggers Sleep at Night?\" is a delightful bedtime story that captures the imagination of young readers with its charming rhymes and endearing illustrations of construction vehicles. The story of these little vehicles asking for one more story before bed resonates well with the nightly routines of many children. It's a perfect addition to any child's bedtime story collection, especially for those who are fans of things that go!"
