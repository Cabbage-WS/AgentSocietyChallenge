    "review": "I stopped by Sunoco A Plus for gas and was disappointed by the experience. The prices were higher than nearby stations, and the service was unfriendly. The cashier was inflexible and unwilling to help when my card was declined at the pump. While the location is convenient, the overall experience left me feeling frustrated and overcharged."
