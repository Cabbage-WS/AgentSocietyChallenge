    "review": "Gusto Pizzeria is a solid neighborhood spot with great pizza and a cozy vibe. The crust is crispy, and the toppings are fresh and flavorful. While it's not the most upscale place, it's perfect for a casual meal with friends or a quick bite. I'll definitely be back for their specials!"
