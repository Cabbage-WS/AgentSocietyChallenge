    "review": "I had high hopes for Gamarjoba, but my experience was disappointing. The food was mediocre, lacking flavor, and the service was slow and unfriendly. It’s a shame because the atmosphere seemed promising, but the overall experience left me feeling underwhelmed. I won’t be returning anytime soon."
