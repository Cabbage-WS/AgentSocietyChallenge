    "review": "Cedars Restaurant exceeded my expectations with its authentic Middle Eastern flavors and warm, welcoming atmosphere. The fresh pita bread and flavorful dishes like the lamb kabobs and baba ganoush were simply delicious. The service was attentive and made the experience even more enjoyable. I can't wait to return and try more of their amazing menu!"
