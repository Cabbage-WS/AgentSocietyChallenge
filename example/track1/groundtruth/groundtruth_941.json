    "review": "I visited Caffeination hoping for a cozy spot to enjoy a good cup of coffee, but the experience was just average. The coffee was decent, but nothing special, and the atmosphere felt a bit too quiet for my taste. While the staff was friendly, it didn’t quite live up to the charm I was expecting from a local café."
