  "review": "I had a terrible experience at Lee Nails. The service was rushed, and the quality of the manicure was abysmal. My nails were uneven, and the polish was applied poorly. The staff was unfriendly and unprofessional, making the entire experience unpleasant. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
