    "review": "Solid Grindz is a gem for anyone craving authentic Hawaiian food. The teriyaki chicken was perfectly grilled, and the katsu chicken was crispy and flavorful. The tuna mac salad was a standout side, just like the ones I remember from Hawaii. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere felt welcoming. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!"
