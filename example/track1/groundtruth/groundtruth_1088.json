  "review": "I had a terrible experience with Katona James A Sr Roofing. They quoted me one price initially, but then demanded an additional 40% increase midway through the job. Their lack of professionalism was evident as they refused to put anything in writing and were unresponsive to my concerns. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
