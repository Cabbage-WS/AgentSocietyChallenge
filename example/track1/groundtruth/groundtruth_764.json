    "review": "Shake Shack delivered a solid experience with their classic burger and fries. The burger was juicy and flavorful, though a bit on the smaller side. The fries were crispy and well-seasoned, though I wish they had more variety in toppings. The service was quick, and the atmosphere was lively, making it a great spot for a casual meal."
