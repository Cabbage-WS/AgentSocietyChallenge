    "review": "The Girard Station is conveniently located and gets the job done for commuting, but it could definitely use some improvements in cleanliness and safety. The area around the station feels a bit sketchy, especially during off-peak hours. Overall, it's functional, but I wouldn't recommend it for first-time visitors or tourists."
