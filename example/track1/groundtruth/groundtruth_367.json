    "review": "I visited The Buzz on a quiet weekday morning, hoping for a relaxing coffee experience. The atmosphere was pleasant, with comfortable seating and a quiet vibe, but the service was a bit slow and unenthusiastic. The coffee was decent, though a bit strong for my taste. While itâ€™s a nice spot to unwind, it could use some improvements in service and menu variety to truly stand out."
