    "review": "Amis Trattoria offers a delightful Italian experience with a creative menu and attentive service. The swordfish meatballs and pecorino with almond honey were standout dishes, showcasing the chef's talent. While the atmosphere can be a bit loud, the food quality and innovative flavors make it worth a visit."
