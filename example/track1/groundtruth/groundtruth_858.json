  "review": "The Fat Ham offers a unique twist on Southern cuisine with its tapas-style menu. The hot chicken was flavorful and spicy, while the shrimp and grits were creamy and satisfying. The cozy atmosphere and attentive service made for a pleasant dining experience, though the small portions left me wanting a bit more. Overall, it's a great spot for a casual yet memorable meal."
