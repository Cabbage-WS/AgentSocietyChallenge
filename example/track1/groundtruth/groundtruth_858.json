    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Retina Centers. The staff was unhelpful, and the doctor I saw was dismissive and uncaring. I had to wait for an extended period, and when I finally saw the doctor, he provided no clear explanation or solution to my issue. This place lacks professionalism and empathy, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
