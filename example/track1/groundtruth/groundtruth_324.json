    "review": "Lima Lim√≥n offers a delightful Peruvian dining experience with flavorful dishes and generous portions. I particularly enjoyed the Lomo Saltado, which was rich in flavor and perfectly balanced. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy, making it a great spot for a casual meal. While there were a few minor inconsistencies, overall, it's a solid choice for authentic Peruvian cuisine."
