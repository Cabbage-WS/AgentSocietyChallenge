  "review": "Twisted Gingers Brewing Company is a solid spot with a great vibe and friendly staff. The beer selection is impressive, and I enjoyed the variety of flavors they offer. The pizza was a pleasant surprise\u2014fresh ingredients and a unique twist on classic toppings. While it\u2019s not the best I\u2019ve ever had, it\u2019s definitely worth trying, especially with a cold brew in hand."
