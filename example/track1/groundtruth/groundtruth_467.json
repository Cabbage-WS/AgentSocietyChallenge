    "review": "I had a mixed experience at The Weave Bar. The stylist was quick, but the quality of the weave was uneven, and I had to adjust it at home. The salon was clean, but the overall service didn't meet my expectations. I might try again with a different stylist, but I'm not entirely satisfied."
