    "review": "I decided to try Chickpeas Falafel & Grill after hearing about their fresh falafel and reasonable prices. The falafel itself was decent, but the hummus was a bit bland and lacked flavor. The service was friendly, but the place felt a bit rundown. Overall, it was an okay experience, but I've had better falafel elsewhere."
