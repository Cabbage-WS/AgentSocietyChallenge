    "review": "The JW Marriott Tucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa is a beautiful oasis in the desert, with stunning views and great amenities like the lazy river and pools. The service was friendly and attentive, though the food options were a bit overpriced. Overall, itâ€™s a great place for a relaxing getaway, especially for families."
