    "review": "I had high hopes for Royal Car Wash, but they were completely dashed. The service was slow, the staff unfriendly, and the results were abysmal. My car was still dirty inside and out, and they even missed spots I could have cleaned myself. This place is a total rip-off and a waste of time. I won't be returning."
