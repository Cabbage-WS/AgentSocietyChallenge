    "review": "Underdogs offers a unique and satisfying hot dog experience with a variety of creative toppings and flavors. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is casual and welcoming. While the fries could be a bit crisper, the overall quality of the hot dogs makes it worth a visit, especially for those looking to try something different in the heart of Philly."
