    "review": "St. Mary's Church is a hidden gem in Philadelphia. The simplicity of the services and the welcoming atmosphere make it a truly special place. The history and the sense of community are palpable, and I felt a deep connection to the past while being present in the moment. Highly recommend visiting for a peaceful and inspiring experience."
