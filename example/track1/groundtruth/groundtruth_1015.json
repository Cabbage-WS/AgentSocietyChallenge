  "review": "I had a good experience at La Vie En Rose Florist & Gifts. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the flowers I ordered were fresh and beautifully arranged. I appreciated their quick service, especially since I needed a same-day order. However, the pricing felt a bit high for what I received, but overall, it was a positive experience."
