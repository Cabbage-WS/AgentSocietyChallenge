  "review": "\"Heaven All Day\" is a beautifully poignant and imaginative story that explores the connection between a lonely factory worker and an abandoned robot. The artwork is stunning, and the narrative is both touching and thought-provoking, making it a must-read for fans of graphic novels and unique storytelling. I was completely drawn into the world and characters, and the ending left me with a sense of wonder and reflection."
