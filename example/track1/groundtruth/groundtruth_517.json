    "review": "The Schuylkill Expressway is a commuter's nightmare. Endless traffic, unpredictable congestion, and a design that feels like it was built for a bygone era make this road a constant source of frustration. While the views of the city skyline can be breathtaking, theyâ€™re hardly worth the hours wasted in gridlock. Avoid this road if you can, or prepare for a journey that feels more like purgatory than an expressway."
