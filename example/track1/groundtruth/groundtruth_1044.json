I especially loved the Honey Citrus Lime Jasmine Tea and the Mango Green Tea with Milk Foam. The chicken wings and sandwiches are also a pleasant surprise\u2014crispy, juicy, and packed with flavor. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. I\u2019ll definitely be back for more!"
