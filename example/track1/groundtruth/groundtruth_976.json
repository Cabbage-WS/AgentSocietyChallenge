    "review": "Yakitori Boy offers a fun and lively atmosphere, especially for karaoke lovers. The food is decent, with a good variety of skewers and sushi, though some dishes could use more seasoning. The private karaoke rooms are a highlight, making it a great spot for groups. Overall, a solid choice for a night out with friends."
