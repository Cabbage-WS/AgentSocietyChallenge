  "review": "I had a decent experience at Kitchen B & L. The food was okay, nothing extraordinary, but it served its purpose. The service, however, left a bit to be desired\u2014the staff seemed a little uninterested and not particularly friendly. It's a decent spot for a quick meal, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."
