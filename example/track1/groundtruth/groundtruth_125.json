    "review": "Shake Shack delivered a solid experience with their classic burgers and fries. The food was fresh and flavorful, and the casual atmosphere made it a great spot for a quick meal. While the service was efficient, it could have been a bit more engaging. Overall, a good spot for a satisfying burger fix."
