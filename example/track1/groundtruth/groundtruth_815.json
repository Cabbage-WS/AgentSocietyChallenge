    "review": "Palma's Cucina exceeded my expectations! The lobster ravioli was divine, with perfectly cooked pasta and a rich, flavorful sauce. The meatballs with ricotta were a standout appetizer, and the service was attentive and friendly. A delightful dining experience that I can't wait to repeat."
