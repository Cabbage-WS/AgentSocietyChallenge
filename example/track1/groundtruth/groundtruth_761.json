    "review": "Kung Fu Tea is a fantastic spot for bubble tea lovers! The variety of flavors and the ability to customize sweetness and toppings make it a standout. I especially loved the taro milk tea with herbal jellyâ€”it was rich, flavorful, and perfectly balanced. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was modern and inviting. Highly recommend this place for a refreshing treat!"
