    "review": "I visited SOHO Juice for the first time and tried their Cloud 9 bowl. The flavor was decent, but I felt the portion size was a bit small for the price. The staff was friendly, but the overall experience didn't quite meet my expectations. I might try it again, but there are other places with better value."
