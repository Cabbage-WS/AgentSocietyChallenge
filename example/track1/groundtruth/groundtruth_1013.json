  "review": "I had high hopes for London Heights, but my experience was a bit underwhelming. The decor is cool, and the vibe is casual, but the food didn't quite live up to expectations. I ordered the fish and chips, and while the batter was crispy, the fish itself was a bit dry. The service was friendly, but the overall experience felt average. I might give it another try for drinks, but the food needs some improvement."
