    "review": "This McDonald's location is by far the worst I've ever experienced. The service was painfully slow, the staff seemed uninterested, and the food was far from fresh. I ordered a burger that was cold and had the wrong toppings. I won't be returning anytime soon and would recommend avoiding this location if possible."
