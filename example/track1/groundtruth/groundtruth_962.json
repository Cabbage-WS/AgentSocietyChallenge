    "review": "I had high expectations for Delilah's after hearing so much hype, but my experience was mixed. The mac and cheese was decent, but not the best I've ever had. The fried chicken was a bit greasy and lacked seasoning. While the service was friendly, the food didn't quite live up to the buzz."
