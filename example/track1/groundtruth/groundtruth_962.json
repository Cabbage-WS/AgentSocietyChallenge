  "review": "Peter Piper Pizza is a decent spot for families, especially with kids. The pizza was okay, nothing extraordinary, but the atmosphere is lively and fun. The free carousel and arcade games add a nice touch, making it a good choice for a casual outing. However, the place could use some improvement in cleanliness and service efficiency."
