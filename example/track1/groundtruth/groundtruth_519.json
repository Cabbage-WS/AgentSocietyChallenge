    "review": "Monsoons Tap & Grill is a solid spot for a casual meal with a good beer selection. The food is decent, with some hits like the burgers and wings, but occasionally inconsistent. The service is friendly, and the atmosphere is laid-back, making it a great place to unwind with friends. Iâ€™ll definitely be back for more craft beers and a relaxed vibe."
