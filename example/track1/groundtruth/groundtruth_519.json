  "review": "\"The Stray\" is a heartwarming and charming tale that captures the essence of family and the unexpected joys that come with it. The old woman's quirky antics and the loving acceptance by the family are beautifully portrayed, making it a delightful read for both children and adults. Dick King-Smith's storytelling is as enchanting as ever, and the book is a perfect choice for a cozy, feel-good read-aloud session."
