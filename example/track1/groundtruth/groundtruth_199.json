    "review": "I had a great experience at D'jakarta Cafe! The food was flavorful and authentic, reminding me of dishes I've had in Indonesia. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. While the menu is a bit limited, the dishes I tried were well-prepared and satisfying. I'll definitely be back to explore more of their offerings!"
