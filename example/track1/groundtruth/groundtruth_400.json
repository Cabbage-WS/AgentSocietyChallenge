    "review": "I had high expectations for Santoro's Pizzeria, and while the pizza was good, it didn't quite blow me away. The crust was crispy, and the sauce had a nice tang, but it felt a bit greasy compared to what I'm used to. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy, but I think there's room for improvement in the overall flavor. I'll definitely give it another try, though!"
