    "review": "I decided to give CJ's Bar-B-Skew a try despite hearing mixed reviews. The atmosphere was unique and fun, with its trippy art and music videos playing on the screens. The food, however, was a bit hit or miss. I enjoyed the variety of sides, but my main dish lacked the flavor I was hoping for. It's an interesting spot, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations."
