    "review": "I decided to give Taco Bus a try despite hearing mixed reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was underwhelming. The tacos lacked flavor and the overall quality felt subpar. While the concept is interesting, the execution didn't meet my expectations. I might give it another shot in the future, but for now, I'm not impressed."
