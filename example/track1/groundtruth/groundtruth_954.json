    "review": "I had high expectations for Vince's Pizzeria after hearing so many rave reviews, but I found the pizza to be just average. The crust was crispy, but the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste, and the cheese didn't stand out. The service was also slow, which added to the disappointment. While it's not a bad place, it didn't live up to the hype for me."
