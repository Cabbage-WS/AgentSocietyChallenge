    "review": "I had a solid experience at Ashtanga Yoga Philadelphia. The instructors are knowledgeable and the Mysore-style classes allow for personalized attention. The atmosphere is welcoming, though the physical space could use some updates. Overall, it's a great place for those serious about Ashtanga yoga."
