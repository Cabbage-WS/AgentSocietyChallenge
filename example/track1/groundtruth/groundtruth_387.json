  "review": "The Voxelab Proxima 6.0 3D Printer is a solid choice for those looking to get into resin printing. It's easy to set up and the print quality is impressive, especially with the 2K monochrome screen. However, I would have liked to see a bit more in terms of customer support for beginners."
