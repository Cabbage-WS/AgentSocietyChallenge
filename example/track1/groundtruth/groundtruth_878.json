    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Sabino Cycles. The staff was unhelpful and seemed more interested in their own conversations than assisting customers. I asked for advice on a bike fitting, but the person I spoke to gave me incorrect information, which led to discomfort during my ride. I won't be returning to this shop."
