  "review": "I had a mixed experience at VAC Motorsports. The staff seemed knowledgeable, but the service was a bit slow, and I felt the pricing was on the higher side. While they did address my car's issue, I expected better communication and a quicker turnaround. Overall, it was decent, but not exceptional."
