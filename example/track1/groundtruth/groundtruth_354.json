    "review": "The Silo Eatery offers a pleasant dining experience with fresh, made-to-order food and a welcoming atmosphere. The variety of options, including keto-friendly items, is a nice touch for different dietary needs. While the service was friendly and efficient, the quality of some dishes could be improved to fully meet expectations. Overall, it's a solid choice for a quick, satisfying meal."
