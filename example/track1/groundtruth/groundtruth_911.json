  "review": "I had a mixed experience at Essentials Deluxe Day Spa. The ambiance was nice, and the staff was friendly, but the massage felt rushed and lacked the pressure I was hoping for. I also noticed that the service was shorter than the advertised time. While I appreciate the effort, I expected a more thorough and relaxing experience."
