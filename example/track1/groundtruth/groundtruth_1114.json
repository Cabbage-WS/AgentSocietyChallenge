  "review": "I had a decent experience at Pet Supermarket. The store is clean and has a good selection of pet supplies, especially for dogs and cats. The staff was friendly and helpful when I needed assistance. While the prices are a bit higher than some other pet stores, the convenience of having everything in one place makes it worth it for me."
