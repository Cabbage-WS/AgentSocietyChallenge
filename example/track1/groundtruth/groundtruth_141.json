    "review": "I had high hopes for Lee's Hoagie House after hearing so much about it, but my experience was just average. The hoagie I ordered was decent, but the bread was a bit too soft for my liking. The service was quick, which was nice, but the overall flavor didn't quite live up to the hype. I might give it another try, but it wasn't the standout sandwich I was expecting."
