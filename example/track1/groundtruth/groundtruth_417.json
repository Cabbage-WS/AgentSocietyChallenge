  "review": "\"Comic Party, Vol. 02\" offers a light and enjoyable read with its blend of humor and manga culture. The characters are engaging, and their interactions provide plenty of laughs. However, the plot feels a bit thin and predictable, which might not satisfy those looking for a deeper story. Still, it's a fun addition to the series for fans of the genre."
