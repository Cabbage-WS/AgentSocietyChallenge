  "review": "\"Beauty and the Beast\" is a classic tale that has stood the test of time, and this edition with illustrations by Walter Crane adds a charming visual element. While the story is familiar and often seen as a bit simplistic, it still delivers a heartwarming message about looking beyond appearances. The illustrations, however, are the true highlight, capturing the essence of the fairy tale in a way that is both elegant and whimsical."
