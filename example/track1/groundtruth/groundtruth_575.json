    "review": "I had a mixed experience at Philly Pizza and Grill. The food was decent, but the service left much to be desired. I ordered a pizza and a cheesesteak, and while the flavors were okay, the delivery was slower than expected. Additionally, there were some issues with the order accuracy, which was frustrating. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but there's definitely room for improvement."
