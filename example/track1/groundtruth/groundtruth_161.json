  "review": "I recently picked up the LR Baggs Violin Pickup for my violin and have been quite impressed. It provides a clear and balanced sound, capturing the nuances of my playing well. The external jack mount is a great addition, making it easy to plug in without altering the instrument's aesthetics. While it's a bit pricey, the quality and performance justify the cost."
