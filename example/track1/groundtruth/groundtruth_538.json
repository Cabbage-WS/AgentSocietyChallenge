    "review": "Amada offers a delightful tapas experience with a wide variety of dishes that showcase Spanish flavors. The ambiance is lively, and the service is attentive. While some dishes were outstanding, a few felt a bit underwhelming, but overall, it's a great spot for sharing and enjoying small plates with friends."
