    "review": "I visited Executive Auto Salon for an auto detailing service and was somewhat satisfied with the results. The staff was friendly and the waiting area was comfortable, but the detailing didn't quite meet my expectations. Some areas of my car still had minor spots that weren't cleaned thoroughly. While the experience wasn't bad, it wasn't exceptional either. I might consider trying them again for a different service, but I'll be more cautious next time."
