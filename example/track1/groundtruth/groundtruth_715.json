  "review": "\"Bosley Sees the World\" is a charming dual language book that effectively introduces children to both Italian and English. The story of Bosley's adventures is engaging and the illustrations are delightful, making it a fun and educational read. It's a great tool for parents and educators looking to introduce a second language to young children in a playful and interactive way."
