    "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Spanish Tapas Cafe. The food was flavorful, and the service was friendly, though the wait time was a bit longer than expected. The Cuban sandwich was well-made, and the portions were generous. I’d recommend it for a casual lunch spot, especially if you’re in the area."
