    "review": "I had a decent time at Tavern 222. The atmosphere was lively, and the drink specials were great, especially the $2 happy hour wells. The bartender was friendly and efficient, making the experience enjoyable. While the place got a bit crowded, it added to the energy. Overall, a good spot for a casual night out."
