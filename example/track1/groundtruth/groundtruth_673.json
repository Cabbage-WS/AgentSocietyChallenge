    "review": "I visited Guavaberry Foods & Drinks recently and was pleasantly surprised by the selection and service. The staff was friendly, and the store had a good variety of items, including some unique options. While the prices were a bit higher than a typical grocery store, it’s understandable given the convenience and location. Overall, it’s a great spot for quick essentials and snacks."
