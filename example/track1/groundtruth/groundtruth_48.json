    "review": "Rai Rai Ramen offers a decent ramen experience, but it falls short in a few areas. The broth was flavorful, but the noodles were slightly overcooked, and the overall portion felt a bit small for the price. The service was friendly, but the atmosphere lacked the cozy vibe I usually expect from a ramen spot. It's a good option if you're in the area, but there are better ramen places in Philly."
