  "review": "\"How to Build the Ghost in Your Attic\" is a unique blend of poetry and sci-fi, offering a fresh take on the Oedipus narrative. The narrative is engaging, with its blend of personal drama and futuristic elements, making it a compelling read. While some of the more avant-garde aspects might not be to everyone's taste, the wit and urgency of the story kept me engaged throughout."
