    "review": "I had a decent experience at House of Pita Hanan. The food was flavorful and authentic, especially the kefta sandwich, which was a standout. The portions were fair for the price, though I wish they were a bit larger. The service was friendly, and the quick turnover made it a convenient option for a quick lunch."
