    "review": "I had high hopes for Diamante Pizzaria based on the variety of menu options, but my experience was disappointing. The pizza was overly oily, and the crust lacked the crispiness I expect. Additionally, the delivery took much longer than expected, which added to the frustration. While the staff was polite, the overall quality of the food and service didn't meet my expectations."
