    "review": "Michael's Chinese Kitchen offers solid, no-frills Chinese takeout that hits the spot. The General Tso's chicken was flavorful and crispy, and the portions were generous. While the ambiance isn't much to write home about, the food quality and quick delivery make it a reliable option for a satisfying meal."
