    "review": "I was excited to try Anytime Fitness since it's open 24/7, but I found the sign-up process frustrating. They require a deposit for the trial pass and proof of residency, which wasn't mentioned clearly online. The gym itself is decent, but the lack of upfront information left me feeling misled. I wish they were more transparent about their policies."
