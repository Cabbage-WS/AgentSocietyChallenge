    "review": "Cereality is a fun and unique concept, especially for cereal lovers. The ability to mix and match cereals and toppings is a great idea, though it does feel a bit overpriced. It’s a nice spot for a quick, quirky breakfast, but I probably wouldn’t make it a regular stop due to the cost."
