    "review": "El Cubanito offers a cozy, authentic Cuban experience with flavorful dishes that hit the spot. The black beans and rice were particularly delicious, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. While the service can be a bit slow, the food more than makes up for it. Iâ€™d definitely recommend it for anyone looking to try Cuban cuisine."
