    "review": "Abe Fisher is a delightful blend of modern and traditional flavors, offering a unique take on Jewish cuisine that truly impressed me. The veal schnitzel tacos and pork belly Reuben were standout dishes, and the service was attentive and friendly. While the atmosphere was a bit noisy, the food more than made up for it, making this a memorable dining experience."
