  "review": "I visited Taco Bell expecting the usual fast-food experience, and while the food was decent, the service left something to be desired. The staff seemed a bit disorganized, and the drive-thru wait was longer than expected. However, the cleanliness of the restaurant was a positive surprise. Overall, it was an average experience, but I might try a different location next time."
