    "review": "I decided to give Mannino's Manayunk a try after hearing some positive reviews, but my experience was mixed. The pizza was decent, with a good balance of toppings, but it lacked a bit of flavor. The service was friendly and quick, which was a plus. Overall, it's an okay spot, but I've had better Italian food elsewhere."
