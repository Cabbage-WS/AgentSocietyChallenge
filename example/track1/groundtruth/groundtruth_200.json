  "review": "The 3ML plastic transfer pipettes and mini plastic funnels from Teenitor are a useful addition to any lab setup, especially for transferring small amounts of liquids. The set is well-packaged and includes a generous amount of pipettes and funnels, which is great for ensuring you always have spares. While they are not the most durable, they are perfectly suitable for occasional use and experiments at home or in educational settings."
