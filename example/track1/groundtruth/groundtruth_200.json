    "review": "Firetruck Brewing has a great selection of beers and a nice outdoor seating area, but the service can be inconsistent. On my visit, the food took a while to arrive, and the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed. While the beer was enjoyable, the overall experience didn't quite meet my expectations."
