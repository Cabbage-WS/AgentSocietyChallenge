    "review": "I ordered from Domino's for a quick dinner, and the experience was solid overall. The pizza arrived hot and fresh, and the delivery was prompt, which is always a plus. The crust could have been a bit crispier, but the toppings were well-balanced and flavorful. The staff was friendly and efficient, making the whole process smooth. Definitely a reliable option for a quick bite!"
