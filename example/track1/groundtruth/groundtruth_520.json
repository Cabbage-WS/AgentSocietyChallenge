    "review": "I had high hopes for China Pagoda given its convenient location, but the experience was underwhelming. The food lacked flavor and freshness, and the service felt indifferent. While it might serve a quick fix for hunger, it doesn't offer a memorable dining experience. Iâ€™d recommend exploring other options in the area for better quality Chinese food."
