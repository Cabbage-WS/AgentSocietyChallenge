    "review": "Catalina Brewing Company offers a cozy and welcoming atmosphere with a great selection of craft beers. I particularly enjoyed the Pecan Doppelbock and the Cherry Tanked Stout, which were both flavorful and unique. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, making the experience even better. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more of their creative brews!"
