    "review": "The Rosewood Bar is a classic neighborhood spot with a no-frills vibe. The bartenders are friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxed, perfect for catching up with friends. While it may not cater to everyone's tastes, itâ€™s a great place for locals who appreciate a simple, unpretentious bar."
