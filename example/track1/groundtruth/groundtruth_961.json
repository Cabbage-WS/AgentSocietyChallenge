    "review": "I had high hopes for Pagoda Noodle Cafe after hearing mixed reviews, but my experience was just average. The food was decent, but nothing stood out as exceptional. The service was a bit slow, and the atmosphere felt a little lackluster. It’s not a bad spot, but it didn’t live up to the hype for me."
