    "review": "I had a decent experience at D & D Automotive. They diagnosed my car's issue quickly and provided a fair quote for the repair. The staff was friendly, and the service was prompt. While the price was a bit higher than I expected, the quality of work seemed solid. Overall, I'd recommend them for honest and reliable auto repair."
