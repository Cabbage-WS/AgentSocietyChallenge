  "review": "I had a terrible experience at Andrew Rosen Orthodontics. The staff was unprofessional and seemed more focused on pushing treatments than listening to my concerns. Dr. Rosen himself was dismissive and didn't take the time to explain anything properly. I left feeling frustrated and misled, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
