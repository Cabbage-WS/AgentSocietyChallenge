    "review": "I stopped by this 7-Eleven during a late-night trip and found the convenience factor to be on point. The store was well-stocked, and the staff was friendly, though a bit slow. However, the area outside seemed a bit sketchy, which made me feel uneasy. Overall, it served its purpose, but I wouldn't visit after dark again."
