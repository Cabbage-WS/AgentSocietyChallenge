    "review": "E & J Pizza has a decent selection of food, and the pizza I tried was pretty good. The delivery was quick, which is a plus, but the overall experience was just average. The service could use some improvement, as there were minor issues with my order. It's a decent option for a quick meal, but it's not outstanding."
