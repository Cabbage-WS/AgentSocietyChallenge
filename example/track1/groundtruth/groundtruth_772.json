    "review": "I had a positive experience with Ed's Auto Glass. They were quick to respond and provided a reasonable price for my windshield replacement. The technicians were efficient and professional, completing the job in a timely manner. While the receptionist could have been more friendly, the overall service was solid and I would recommend them for auto glass needs."
