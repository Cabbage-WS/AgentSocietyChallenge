  "review": "\"The Pumpkin Runner\" is a delightful and inspiring story that celebrates the spirit of perseverance and the joy of running. I particularly enjoyed the unique character of Joshua Summerhayes, who, with his unconventional approach and steadfast determination, teaches us that true success lies in the journey, not just the destination. The illustrations by Brad Sneed are vibrant and perfectly capture the essence of the narrative, making this book a wonderful read for children and adults alike."
