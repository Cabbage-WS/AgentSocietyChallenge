    "review": "Mission BBQ exceeded my expectations with its friendly staff and patriotic atmosphere. The brisket was tender and flavorful, though the Mac and cheese was a bit underwhelming. The daily National Anthem at noon was a nice touch, adding a sense of pride to the dining experience. I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu."
