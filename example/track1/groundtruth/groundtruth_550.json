    "review": "Living at Campus Apartments has been a mixed experience. The location is convenient, but the maintenance issues and lack of responsiveness are frustrating. I've had to deal with pests and broken appliances, and the staff doesn't seem to prioritize resolving these problems quickly. It's disappointing given the high rent."
