    "review": "Cimarron Animal Hospital has been a solid choice for my pet's needs. The staff is friendly and the facility is clean, which makes the experience more comfortable for both me and my pet. While there have been a few minor hiccups in communication, overall, the care and attention provided have been commendable. I appreciate their willingness to accommodate and their reasonable pricing."
