    "review": "I had high hopes for The Bronze Table after hearing about their fresh pasta, but my experience was just okay. I ordered the tagliatelle with bolognese sauce, and while the pasta was cooked well, the sauce lacked depth and flavor. The portion was generous, but the overall taste didn't live up to the hype. I might give it another try, but I was a bit disappointed."
