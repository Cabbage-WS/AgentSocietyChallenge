    "review": "R Place Bar & Grill is a solid neighborhood spot with a laid-back vibe. The burgers are juicy and flavorful, and the full bar offers a decent selection of beers. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is casual, making it a great place to unwind. Iâ€™ll definitely be back to try more of their menu!"
