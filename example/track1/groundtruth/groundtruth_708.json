    "review": "CBK Catering & Events truly exceeded my expectations! The food was not only delicious but beautifully presented, and the staff were incredibly professional and attentive. I had a brunch event, and the strawberry citrus salad and creme brûlée French toast were standout dishes. I highly recommend them for any event—they made my special day unforgettable!"
