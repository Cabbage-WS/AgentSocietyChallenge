    "review": "I had a disappointing experience at Shoe Palace. The staff member I interacted with was unprofessional and seemed more focused on his personal conversations than assisting me. Additionally, I felt pressured into purchasing unnecessary items, which left me frustrated. This store does not live up to its reputation for customer service."
