  "review": "I ordered the chicken teriyaki and a few sushi rolls from Hibachi 2 Go. The chicken teriyaki was decent, but the portion of meat was smaller than expected. The sushi rolls were okay, though the rice was a bit too sticky. For the price, it's not bad, but I've had better sushi elsewhere."
