    "review": "Justhai offers a convenient and quick Thai food experience, but it falls short of being truly authentic. The touch-screen ordering system is efficient, and the food is prepared quickly, but the flavors feel somewhat watered down compared to traditional Thai cuisine. While the atmosphere is clean and modern, the overall experience is more like fast food than a sit-down Thai restaurant."
