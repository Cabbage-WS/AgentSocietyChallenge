    "review": "Uzu Sushi offers a cozy and intimate dining experience with fresh and flavorful sushi. The service is attentive, and the BYOB aspect adds to the charm. While the portions are on the smaller side, the quality of the fish and creative rolls make up for it. A great spot for a quiet date night or a quick sushi fix."
