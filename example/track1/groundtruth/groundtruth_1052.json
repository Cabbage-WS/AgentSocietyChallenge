  "review": "I visited PC Restaurant for a quick breakfast during a busy workday. The food was decent, but the service felt a bit rushed and impersonal. The menu options were simple, which I liked, but the execution could have been better. I might give it another try for brunch, but it didn't leave a strong impression on me."
