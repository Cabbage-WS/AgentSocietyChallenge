    "review": "The Brunchery offers a cozy, homey atmosphere with delicious breakfast options. I tried the stuffed French toast, which was absolutely delightful, and the service was friendly and attentive. While the space is a bit tight, it adds to the charm of this local gem. Iâ€™ll definitely be back for more!"
