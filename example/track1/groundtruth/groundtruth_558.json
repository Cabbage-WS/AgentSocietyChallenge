  "review": "\"Death's Academy\" is a delightful and humorous take on the grim reaper theme, combining fantasy and humor in a way that is both engaging and refreshing. Midnight Smith's struggle with exams and his unlikely alliance with the Guardian Angels add a unique twist to the story. The humorous encounters with unicorns and other deadly creatures make this book a fun and entertaining read for fans of light-hearted fantasy."
