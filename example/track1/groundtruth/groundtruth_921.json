    "review": "Lickety Split offers a decent experience with its large pizza slices and casual atmosphere. The service was friendly, and the prices were reasonable. However, the overall vibe felt a bit divey, and the cleanliness could be improved. It's a good spot for a quick bite but not somewhere I'd go out of my way for."
