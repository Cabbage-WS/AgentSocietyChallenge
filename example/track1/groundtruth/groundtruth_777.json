    "review": "Smith & Wollensky offers a classic steakhouse experience with a nice atmosphere, but the food didn't quite live up to the hype. The steak was decent, but it felt overpriced for what it was. Service was attentive, though, and the view of Rittenhouse Square is a nice bonus. Overall, it's a good spot for a special occasion, but not a must-visit for steak lovers."
