    "review": "I really enjoyed my visit to Giant Heirloom Market. The selection of local and organic products is impressive, and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. While the store is on the smaller side, it still manages to offer a wide variety of essentials and specialty items. I especially appreciated the focus on fresh produce and the convenient self-checkout system."
