    "review": "The Dragon Fire Grill offers a variety of food options in a large, air-conditioned space, which is a nice break from the heat. The food quality is decent for theme park standards, though it can be a bit hit or miss. The service was efficient, and the live show added some entertainment value. Overall, it's a good spot to grab a meal if you're in Busch Gardens, but don't expect gourmet dining."
