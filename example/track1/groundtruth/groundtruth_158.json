    "review": "The Chilly Banana is a delightful gem! The banana-based ice cream is creamy, flavorful, and surprisingly satisfying. I tried the Rainbow Road with its colorful toppings, and it was a treat for both the eyes and taste buds. The vegan and dairy-free options make it a great choice for everyone, and the friendly staff added to the wonderful experience. Highly recommend!"
