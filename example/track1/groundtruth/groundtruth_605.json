    "review": "Riding Sun Tran has been a mixed experience for me. While the buses are generally clean and some drivers are friendly, the inconsistent schedules and lack of reliable transfers make it frustrating to use. I’ve had multiple instances where buses were either early or late, causing me to miss important connections. It’s clear that improvements are needed to make this service more user-friendly."
