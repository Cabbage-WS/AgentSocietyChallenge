    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Brows by Meriem. The technician was unprofessional and rushed through the procedure, leaving my eyebrows uneven and poorly shaped. When I expressed my concerns, she dismissed them and showed no interest in fixing the issue. I regret choosing this place and will not be returning."
