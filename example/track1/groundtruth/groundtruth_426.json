    "review": "I had high hopes for Megabus after hearing about the affordable prices, but my experience was disappointing. The bus was over an hour late, and the lack of communication from the staff made the wait even more frustrating. The ride itself was uncomfortable, and the WiFi didnâ€™t work, which was a major letdown. I expected better service for the price I paid."
