  "review": "\"Tom Sawyer Abroad\" is a whimsical and often humorous adventure that sees Twain\u2019s classic characters exploring the wilds of Africa. While the premise is intriguing and the narrative retains Twain\u2019s characteristic wit, the story feels a bit thin and lacks the depth and social commentary of his more celebrated works. Still, it\u2019s a fun read for fans of the series and those who enjoy light-hearted, adventurous tales."
