  "review": "I visited HaoTea expecting a decent bubble tea experience, but it fell a bit short of my expectations. The drinks were okay, but they lacked the depth of flavor I\u2019ve had at other bubble tea places. The service was slow due to only one worker handling everything, which was a bit frustrating. However, the ambiance was nice, and the prices were reasonable."
