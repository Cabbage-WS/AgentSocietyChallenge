    "review": "The Current Hotel has a stunning modern design and a great location with beautiful views of the bay. However, the service was inconsistent, and some aspects, like the mandatory valet parking and lack of attention to detail, were frustrating. While the overall experience was pleasant, it didn't fully meet my expectations for a boutique hotel."
