  "review": "I had a disappointing experience with Philadelphia Federal Credit Union. The staff seemed uninterested in helping, and the long wait times were frustrating. I also encountered unnecessary fees, which added to my dissatisfaction. While the location is convenient, the overall service left much to be desired."
