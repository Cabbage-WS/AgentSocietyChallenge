    "review": "I visited Champion Pool and Spa Supply to get some advice and supplies for my pool. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, but I felt they were a bit pushy with their recommendations. I ended up buying some chemicals, but Iâ€™m not sure if they were entirely necessary. Overall, it was an okay experience, but I might look elsewhere next time."
