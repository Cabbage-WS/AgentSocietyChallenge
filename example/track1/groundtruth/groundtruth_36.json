    "review": "I visited Michaels hoping to find some craft supplies for a project, but the experience was underwhelming. The store was cluttered and disorganized, making it difficult to find what I needed. Additionally, the checkout process was frustrating with only one cashier available, leading to a long wait. While the staff was friendly, the overall experience left me feeling disappointed."
