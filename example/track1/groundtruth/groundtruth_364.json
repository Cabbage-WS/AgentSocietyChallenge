    "review": "I had a decent experience at Halal Gyro Express. The chicken over rice was flavorful, and the white sauce added a nice touch. The portion was generous for the price, and the staff was friendly. While it wasn't the best halal I've ever had, it's a solid option for a quick, affordable meal in the city."
