    "review": "I recently visited Schenk's Family Bakery and was quite impressed with their selection and quality. The strawberry shortcake was delicious, with fresh strawberries and just the right amount of sweetness. The staff was friendly and the place had a cozy, family-run vibe. While the prices were reasonable, I did find the icing on the pound cake a bit too sugary for my taste. Overall, a great spot for baked goods!"
