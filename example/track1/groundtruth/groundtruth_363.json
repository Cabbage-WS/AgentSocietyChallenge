    "review": "Cold Stone Creamery is a reliable spot for delicious ice cream, and this location doesn't disappoint. The staff is friendly, and the ice cream is always creamy and satisfying. While the prices are a bit steep, the quality makes it worth it. I especially enjoy the mix-ins they offer, which add a fun twist to the classic flavors."
