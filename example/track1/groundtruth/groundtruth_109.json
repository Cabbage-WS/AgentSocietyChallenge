    "review": "Modo Mio Taverna offers a delightful dining experience with a cozy atmosphere and delicious Italian cuisine. The menu is creative and well-executed, with standout dishes like the Tagliatelli Modo Mio and the Peking Duck. While the service was attentive, the pacing of the meal could have been improved. Overall, it's a charming spot worth visiting for a memorable meal."
