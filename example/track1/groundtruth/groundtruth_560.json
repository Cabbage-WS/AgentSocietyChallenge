    "review": "I had a terrible experience with You Call We Haul. After scheduling and confirming my appointment, they completely ghosted me on the day of service. No call, no show, and no explanation. I had to scramble to find another solution, which was incredibly frustrating. This kind of unprofessional behavior is unacceptable and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
