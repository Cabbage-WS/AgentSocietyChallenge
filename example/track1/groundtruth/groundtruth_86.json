    "review": "La Teresita Grocery is a hidden gem for anyone craving authentic Cuban and Latin American food. The selection of prepared dishes is impressive, and the prices are unbeatable. I tried the roast pork with yellow rice and plantains, and it was delicious. The grocery section is also well-stocked with hard-to-find ingredients, making it a great spot for cooking enthusiasts. The only minor downside is the lack of seating, but the food quality more than makes up for it."
