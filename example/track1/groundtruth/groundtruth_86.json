  "review": "The AMJ-M3.5 screws are a great assortment for various DIY projects. They are sturdy and do not require pre-drilling, which is a significant time-saver. While the black phosphate finish looks good and is rust-resistant, I found the screws a bit harder to work with on softer woods, but overall, they are a solid addition to any tool kit."
