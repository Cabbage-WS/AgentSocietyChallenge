    "review": "Frost Gelato is a delightful treat! The variety of flavors is impressive, and the staff is friendly and helpful, offering generous samples. I especially loved the sea salt caramel and pistachioâ€”both were creamy and delicious. A must-visit for anyone craving a sweet, refreshing dessert!"
