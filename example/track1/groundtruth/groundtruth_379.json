    "review": "Termini Bros Bakery is a must-visit for anyone with a sweet tooth! The cannoli is hands down the best I've ever hadâ€”freshly filled, perfectly sweet, and packed with flavor. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is lively, making it a great spot to indulge in some delicious treats. Highly recommend it to anyone visiting Philadelphia!"
