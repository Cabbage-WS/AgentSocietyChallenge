  "review": "I visited Rittenhouse Needlepoint with high hopes, but my experience was disappointing. The staff seemed uninterested in helping me, and I felt rushed through my purchase. While the selection of materials is impressive, the customer service left much to be desired. I won't be returning anytime soon."
