    "review": "I visited Copper Rock Craft Eatery with high expectations, but my experience was mixed. The ambiance was nice, and the outdoor seating was pleasant. However, the service was slow, and the food, while decent, lacked the wow factor I was hoping for. The prices were a bit steep for what was delivered. I might give it another try, but it didn't quite live up to the hype."
