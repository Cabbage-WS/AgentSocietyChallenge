    "review": "I had a decent experience at Mood Indian Restaurant. The food was flavorful, especially the chicken tikka masala, which was rich and well-seasoned. The service was prompt, and the staff was friendly. However, the portion sizes felt a bit small for the price, which was slightly disappointing. Overall, it's a good spot for Indian food, but I wish the value was a bit better."
