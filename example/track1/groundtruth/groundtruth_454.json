    "review": "I had high hopes for Grubaholics based on the rave reviews, but my experience was incredibly disappointing. The service was slow, and the food took forever to arrive. When it finally did, the jerk chicken cheesesteak was bland and lacked the promised flavor. I couldn't help but feel let down, especially after hearing so many positive things. This was a far cry from the great food I was expecting."
