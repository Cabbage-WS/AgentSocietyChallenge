  "review": "Mortal Kombat Trilogy on the Nintendo 64 is a disappointing entry in the series, plagued by poor graphics and subpar sound quality. While it does offer a variety of play modes and a decent roster of characters, the performance issues and lack of key characters from other versions make it a hard sell. It feels like a rushed port that doesn't do justice to the Mortal Kombat legacy."
