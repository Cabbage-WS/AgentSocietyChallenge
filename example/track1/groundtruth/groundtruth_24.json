    "review": "Mario's Trattoria and Bar offers a cozy, neighborhood vibe with solid Italian cuisine. The pizza and pasta dishes are particularly noteworthy, with fresh ingredients and flavorful sauces. While the service can be a bit slow at times, the friendly staff and authentic flavors make it worth the visit. A great spot for casual dining with a touch of Italian charm."
