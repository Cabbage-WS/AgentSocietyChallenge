    "review": "I had a frustrating experience at U-Haul Moving & Storage at Westchase. The staff seemed disorganized, and I had to wait longer than expected to pick up my reserved truck. The process was confusing, and I felt like I was being rushed through. I won't be returning here for future rentals."
