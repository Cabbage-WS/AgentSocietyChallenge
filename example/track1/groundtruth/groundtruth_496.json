    "review": "I had high hopes for Salerno's based on the reviews, but my experience was just average. The food was decent, but nothing stood out as exceptional. The service was friendly, but the overall vibe felt a bit underwhelming. It's a good option for a casual meal, but I wouldn't rush back."
