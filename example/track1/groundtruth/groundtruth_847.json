    "review": "I had high hopes for Islamorada Fish Company, but the experience fell flat. The food was mediocre, and the service was slow despite the restaurant being nearly empty. The fish and chips were greasy, and the fries were cold. It’s a shame, as the atmosphere is nice, but the execution just didn’t match up. I won’t be rushing back."
