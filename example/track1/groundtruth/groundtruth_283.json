    "review": "I absolutely loved my visit to Paletas Y Helados Bambino! The variety of ice cream flavors is incredible, and the quality is top-notch. I tried the strawberry cheesecake and it was creamy and delicious. The prices are also very reasonable, making it a great spot for a sweet treat. Highly recommend!"
