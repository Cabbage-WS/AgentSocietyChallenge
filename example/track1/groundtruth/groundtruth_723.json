    "review": "We Rock The Spectrum is a great spot for kids, especially those with sensory needs. The facility is clean, well-organized, and the staff is friendly. My kids had a blast exploring all the activities, from the trampoline to the sensory-friendly toys. While the management issues mentioned in some reviews are concerning, our experience was positive and weâ€™ll definitely be back."
