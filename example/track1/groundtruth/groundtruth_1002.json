  "review": "Olive Garden is a reliable choice for Italian comfort food. The unlimited soup and salad combo is a standout, and the breadsticks are always a treat. While the food is consistent, it doesn't quite reach the level of authenticity I've experienced at other Italian spots. Service was attentive, though, and the atmosphere is cozy for a casual meal."
