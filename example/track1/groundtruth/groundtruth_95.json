    "review": "I had a terrible experience at Liz Murtagh Boutique. The customer service was appalling, and the staff were unhelpful and dismissive. I tried to exchange an item, but they refused, even though it was within a reasonable timeframe. I won't be returning to this shop, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
