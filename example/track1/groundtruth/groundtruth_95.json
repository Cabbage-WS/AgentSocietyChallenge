  "review": "I recently purchased the M-Audio Keystation 88ES and it has been a great addition to my studio setup. The keyboard feels solid and responsive, and the USB connectivity makes it incredibly easy to use with my computer. While it's not fully weighted, it still provides a good balance for both playing and programming."
