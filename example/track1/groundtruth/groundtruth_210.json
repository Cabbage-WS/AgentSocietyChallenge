    "review": "I had a mixed experience at IDentical All About Your Smile. The office was clean and modern, and the staff was friendly. However, I felt that the dentist was a bit rushed and didn't explain things as thoroughly as I would have liked. While the cleaning was fine, I left feeling a bit unsure about the overall care."
