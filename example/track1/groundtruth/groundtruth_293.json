    "review": "I had a disappointing experience at The Olde City Day School. The communication from the staff was lacking, and I felt like my concerns were brushed aside. While the facility is nice, the overall experience left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a parent. I wouldn't recommend it based on my interactions."
