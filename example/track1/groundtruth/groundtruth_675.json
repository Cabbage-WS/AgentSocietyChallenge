    "review": "I visited Zen Reflexology & Massage Spa hoping for a relaxing experience, but it fell a bit short of my expectations. The massage was decent, but the lack of privacy due to the curtained rooms was a bit unsettling. The staff was friendly, but communication was challenging. While it wasn't a terrible experience, I think there's room for improvement."
