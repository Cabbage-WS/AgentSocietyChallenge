    "review": "Criniti's offers a solid Italian dining experience with a cozy, old-school vibe. The food is hearty and flavorful, especially the garlic bread and red sauce dishes. While the service was attentive, the ambiance could use a bit of modernization. Overall, it's a great spot for a casual meal with friends or family."
