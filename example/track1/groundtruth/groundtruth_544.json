    "review": "This Starbucks location is a solid spot for grabbing a quick coffee or settling in to study. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is welcoming, with plenty of seating and outlets. While it can get crowded, especially during peak hours, itâ€™s a reliable choice for both students and locals."
