    "review": "PJ Subs is a solid spot for a hearty sandwich. I tried the Philly cheesesteak, and it hit the mark with its tender meat and flavorful toppings. The atmosphere is casual, and the service was friendly, though a bit slow during peak times. Overall, it's a great option for a quick, satisfying meal."
