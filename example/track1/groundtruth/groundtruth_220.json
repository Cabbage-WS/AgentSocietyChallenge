    "review": "New World Brewery is a hidden gem in Ybor City with a fantastic beer selection and a laid-back atmosphere. The outdoor seating area is perfect for relaxing, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. While the food menu is limited, the pizzas and BBQ are surprisingly good. A great spot for craft beer lovers!"
