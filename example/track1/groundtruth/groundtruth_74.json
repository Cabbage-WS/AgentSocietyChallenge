    "review": "I visited Sonic hoping for a quick and enjoyable meal, but the experience was a bit mixed. The staff was friendly, but the food quality was inconsistent. My burger was overcooked, and the fries were cold. The cherry limeade, however, was refreshing. While the service was decent, the overall experience didn't quite meet my expectations."
