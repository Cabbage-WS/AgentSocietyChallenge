    "review": "I had a good experience at AAG Glass & Tint. The staff was friendly, and the work on my windshield was done efficiently. While there were a few minor hiccups with communication, the overall quality of the service made up for it. Iâ€™d recommend them for their professionalism and reasonable prices."
