    "review": "I had high hopes for Kingdom Textbooks, but my experience was incredibly frustrating. I made multiple trips during their posted hours, only to find the store closed each time. Their unreliable hours and lack of communication are inexcusable. It's a shame because the concept is great, but their execution is severely lacking."
