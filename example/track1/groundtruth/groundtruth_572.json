    "review": "This Starbucks location has a lot of potential, but it falls short in several areas. The staff seems uninterested and often distracted, which makes the experience feel lackluster. Additionally, the inconsistency in drink quality and availability of basic ingredients is frustrating. While the space is clean and spacious, the overall service needs significant improvement."
