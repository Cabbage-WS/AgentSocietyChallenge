  "review": "\"Geisha offers a unique blend of sci-fi and art, with a compelling narrative about an android's struggle for acceptance and recognition in a human-dominated world. The artwork is bold and expressive, adding depth to the story. However, the pacing and character development could be more robust, making it a good, though not exceptional, read for fans of the genre.\""
