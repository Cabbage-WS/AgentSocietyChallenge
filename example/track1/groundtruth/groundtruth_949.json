    "review": "Doc Magrogan's has a great atmosphere and a solid selection of oysters, but the overall experience left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. The service was slow, and the food, while decent, didn't quite live up to the price. I might come back for the happy hour, but I'm not rushing to return for a full meal."
