    "review": "I had the chance to try The Flattery at a food truck event, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flatbread I ordered was flavorful and well-crafted, with a perfect balance of ingredients. While the price was a bit steep, the quality made it worth it. Iâ€™d definitely try it again to explore more of their creative menu."
