    "review": "I had a solid experience at Sahara Indian Cuisine. The food was flavorful and delivered quickly, which is always a plus. The chicken tikka masala was particularly good, though I felt the naan could have been a bit fresher. Overall, it's a great option for Indian takeout in the area."
