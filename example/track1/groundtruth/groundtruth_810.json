  "review": "Haven offers a sophisticated dining experience with a great selection of cheeses and charcuterie. The ambiance is upscale yet welcoming, and the service is attentive. While the menu is a bit pricey, the quality of the food and the unique dishes make it worth the visit. I particularly enjoyed the cheese board and the creative cocktails."
