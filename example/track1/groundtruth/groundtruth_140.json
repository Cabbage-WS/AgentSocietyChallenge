    "review": "Philly Dawgz surprised me with their authentic Chicago-style hot dogs, complete with neon green relish and all the classic toppings. The owner's passion and story added a unique charm to the experience. While the Italian beef didn't quite meet my expectations, the overall vibe and friendly service make it worth a visit for hot dog lovers."
