  "review": "I visited SOHO Juice - Tampa with low expectations after reading mixed reviews, but unfortunately, it didn't meet even those. The acai bowl I ordered was underwhelming and watery, and the price seemed very high for the quality received. The staff was inattentive and unresponsive when I mentioned my concerns, which is a recurring issue I've noticed in my previous experiences. I appreciate the vegan and gluten-free options, but the execution and service fell short. Not a place I would recommend or return to."
