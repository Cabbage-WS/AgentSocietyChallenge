  "review": "Pita King Express offers a delightful Middle Eastern experience with fresh, flavorful dishes. I tried the gyro, which was packed with juicy meat and topped with delicious tzatziki sauce. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was clean and welcoming. While the prices are a bit high, the quality of the food makes it worth a visit."
