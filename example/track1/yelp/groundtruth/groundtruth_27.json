  "review": "Vale Food Co is a decent spot for a quick, healthy meal. The family-friendly atmosphere and affordable prices are a plus, making it a good choice for those with kids. The food is generally fresh, with a variety of options like acai bowls and poke bowls. However, the service can be slow, and there have been instances of inconsistent portion sizes and availability of menu items. While the overall experience is satisfactory, there's definitely room for improvement in terms of service and consistency."
