  "review": "I had high expectations for Not Your Average Joe's Pizza, given its reputation for NY-style pies. The pizza was decent, with a thin crust and decent toppings, but it didn't quite live up to the hype. The atmosphere was casual, and the staff was friendly, but the overall experience felt a bit underwhelming. It's a solid option for a quick slice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."
