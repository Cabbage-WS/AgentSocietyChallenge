  "review": "I visited The Taste of Brazil - Philadelphia and had a mixed experience. The food was generally good, with well-seasoned meats and a variety of options. However, the service was a bit inconsistent. While some staff members were friendly and attentive, others were slower and less responsive, leading to a longer wait time for our food. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming, but the parking lot was small and crowded. Overall, it was a decent experience, but there is room for improvement in terms of service consistency."
