  "review": "La Teresita Grocery is a fantastic place for those looking for authentic Spanish and Cuban cuisine. The food is delicious, and the portion sizes are generous, making it a great value for money. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the cultural atmosphere is welcoming. While it doesn't specialize in vegan ice cream, the quality and authenticity of the food make it a worthwhile visit. The only minor downsides are that some dishes can be a bit salty, and the seating area is better suited for takeout. Overall, a highly recommended spot for a cultural food experience."
