  "review": "I visited Players Sports Bar with some friends, and while the initial friendly service and a few good dishes like the Philly cheesesteak and fries were appreciated, the overall experience was disappointing. The service was extremely slow, and we had to wait a long time for our food and drinks. Additionally, the prices felt a bit steep for the quality of the food, which had some issues with preparation and cleanliness. I can't say I would recommend this place, especially given the better options available in the area."
