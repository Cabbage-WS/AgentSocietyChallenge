  "review": "I visited OK Lee Produce hoping for a good deal on fresh produce, but I was disappointed. While the prices are low, the quality is inconsistent. I bought some peppers and berries, but they were already starting to spoil by the time I got home. It seems like you get what you pay for here, and I won't be returning anytime soon."
