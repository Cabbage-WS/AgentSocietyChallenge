  "review": "Family Eyecare at Westchase is an exceptional optometry practice that truly stands out. The staff, particularly Dr. Mertzlufft, are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive, making the entire experience delightful. The office is clean and well-maintained, and they offer convenient hours, including Saturdays, which is a huge plus. The only potential downside could be the parking lot, but it's managed well and didn't detract from my positive visit. Highly recommend!"
