He arrived on time, communicated effectively, and did a meticulous job with my plumbing repairs. What stood out the most was the fair pricing and honesty\u2014no hidden fees or exorbitant charges. The customer service was exceptional, and I felt confident and comfortable throughout the process. I highly recommend JJM Plumbing for any plumbing needs."
