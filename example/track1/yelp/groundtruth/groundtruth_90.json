  "review": "I recently had the opportunity to work with Walter Wood Real Estate for property management services. While the location and initial interactions were promising, the overall experience fell short of my expectations. The management was slow to respond to maintenance requests, and the property was not as clean as it should have been upon move-in. These issues significantly impacted my satisfaction, and the lack of clear communication added to the frustration. I appreciate the reasonable rent and good location, but the service and maintenance problems make it difficult to recommend this business."
