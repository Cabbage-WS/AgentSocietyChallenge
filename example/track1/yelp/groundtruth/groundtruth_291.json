  "review": "I visited Customs Coffee House and found it to be a mixed bag. The coffee was reasonably priced and decent, and the staff were friendly. However, the cleanliness of the place was a major letdown, with dirty counters and bathrooms. The food, particularly the breakfast sandwiches, was overpriced and lacked flavor, which is a deal-breaker for me. While the atmosphere is cozy and the free Wi-Fi is a plus, the overall experience fell short of my expectations due to the cleanliness and food quality issues."
