  "review": "I had mixed feelings about 1-800-DRY-ME-OUT. While they responded quickly to my water damage emergency and seemed professional at first, the lack of follow-up and communication was frustrating. The team did a decent job, but I noticed some unprofessional behavior, which made me hesitant to recommend them. The pricing was fair, but the inconsistency in service quality left me unsure if I would use them again."
