  "review": "GasMasters offers a mix of positive and negative experiences, which aligns with my general preferences but also raises some concerns. The staff are generally professional and knowledgeable, and the pricing is fair and transparent, which I appreciate. However, the inconsistent quality of service and poor after-installation support are significant drawbacks. While the initial service was quick and efficient, the follow-up was lacking, which is a deal-breaker for me. I would recommend them with some reservations, especially for those who value consistent and reliable service."
