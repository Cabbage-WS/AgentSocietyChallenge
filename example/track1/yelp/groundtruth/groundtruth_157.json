  "review": "I visited the Humane Society of Tampa Bay and found it to be a clean and friendly environment, which aligns with what I value in a business. The staff was generally caring and professional, and the facility itself was welcoming. However, I did notice some long wait times, which can be frustrating, especially with pets. Additionally, there were a few areas where the cleanliness could be improved. Overall, it's a solid place for pet services, but there's room for improvement in efficiency and consistency."
