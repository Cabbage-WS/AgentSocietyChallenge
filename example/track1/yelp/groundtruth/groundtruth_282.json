  "review": "I visited Super Fratelli's Pizza with high hopes, but my experience was quite disappointing. While the pizza was indeed delicious and the prices were reasonable, the service was a major letdown. The wait time for my order was unacceptably long, and the staff at the counter were unfriendly and unhelpful. Additionally, my order was incomplete, which added to the frustration. For a place that prides itself on quick service, these issues are unacceptable. I appreciate the quality of the food, but the poor service and long wait times make it difficult to recommend."
