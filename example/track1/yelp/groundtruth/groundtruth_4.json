  "review": "I had a terrible experience with Katona James A Sr Roofing. The service was unreliable and unresponsive, which is a huge red flag for me. Jim initially quoted a low price but kept increasing it as the work progressed, leading to significant financial stress. The quality of work was also poor, resulting in further leaks and water damage. His unprofessional behavior, including rude interactions and lack of transparency, made the entire process a nightmare. I cannot recommend this business to anyone."
