  "review": "I had a very disappointing experience at Drexel Medicine. The wait times were excessively long, and the staff seemed rushed and inattentive. The office management was particularly frustrating, with issues in scheduling and billing that were never adequately resolved. These problems are consistent with my previous experiences with poorly managed healthcare providers, and I would not recommend this practice to anyone."
