  "review": "Amis Trattoria is a delightful Italian restaurant that aligns well with my preferences for quality food and excellent service. The pasta dishes, especially the cacio e pepe and swordfish meatballs, are outstanding and consistently praised. The ambiance is charming and cozy, making it perfect for both casual dinners and special occasions. While the prices are on the higher side, the quality and service justify the cost. However, the noise level can be a bit high, which might detract from the dining experience. Overall, it's a solid choice for a memorable Italian meal."
