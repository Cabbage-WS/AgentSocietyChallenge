  "review": "I visited 12th Street Cantina at Reading Terminal Market and had a mixed experience. The food was generally fresh and tasty, especially the fish tacos, which were a highlight. The portion sizes were generous, and the staff were friendly, which is always a plus. However, the service was a bit inconsistent, and there were times when the staff seemed overwhelmed. Additionally, the prices felt a bit steep for the overall quality of the food, particularly the burritos, which were somewhat bland. While it's a decent spot for a quick lunch, it didn't quite live up to my expectations for a more exceptional dining experience."
