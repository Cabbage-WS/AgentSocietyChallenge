  "review": "I had a fantastic experience at Booker's Restaurant and Bar. The ambiance is elegant and comfortable, with a romantic and trendy vibe that suits both casual and special occasions. The service was top-notch\u2014attentive without being intrusive, and the staff was very accommodating. I particularly enjoyed the outdoor seating, which was a pleasant surprise. The food was delicious, with well-executed dishes like the chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. While the portion sizes could be a bit larger, the quality and flavor more than make up for it. I highly recommend Booker's for a memorable dining experience."
