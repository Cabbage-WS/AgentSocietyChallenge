  "review": "I recently stayed at the Motel 6 in Tucson, and while it had a few redeeming qualities, the overall experience was underwhelming. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, which is a plus. However, the lack of modern amenities like a refrigerator and microwave was a significant drawback. The paid WiFi was unreliable, and the noise from the freeway was noticeable, though it didn't disrupt my sleep. The staff at the front desk were friendly, but the overall value for the price was lacking. Given my preference for respectful and attentive service, the Motel 6 fell short in providing a comfortable and enjoyable stay."
