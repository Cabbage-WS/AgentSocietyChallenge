  "review": "Pho Xe Lua Viet Thai Restaurant is a mixed bag. The food is delicious and the portions are generous, which is great for the price. However, the service can be slow and inattentive, and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired. I've had better experiences with more attentive staff and cleaner dining areas, which are important to me. While the food is a highlight, the overall experience was not as enjoyable as I hoped."
