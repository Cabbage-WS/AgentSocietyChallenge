  "review": "I visited \"Writer's Block Rehab\" and found it to be a unique and creative spot with a cozy atmosphere. The cocktails were well-crafted and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. However, the space was a bit cramped, and it felt a bit too quiet for my taste, especially during a Friday night. While the drinks were enjoyable, the limited seating and the relaxed vibe didn't quite meet my expectations for a more lively and bustling environment. Overall, it's a nice place to unwind, but it didn't fully align with my preferences."
