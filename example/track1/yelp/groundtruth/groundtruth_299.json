The dishes, such as Lomo Saltado and ceviche, are fresh and delicious, with generous portion sizes that offer great value for money. The restaurant is clean and welcoming, and the staff are friendly and attentive. While the early closing time and occasional service inconsistency are minor drawbacks, the overall experience is excellent. Highly recommended for those looking for a taste of Peru!"
