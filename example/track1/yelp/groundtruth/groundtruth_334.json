  "review": "I visited Halal Gyro Express and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the friendly service. The lamb gyro was delicious, fresh, and well-seasoned, and the portion sizes were generous for the price. The staff was very attentive and remembered regular customers, which made the experience even better. While the menu is a bit limited, the items they offer are top-notch. The only minor downside is that the hot sauce can be quite spicy, but that's a matter of personal preference. Overall, I highly recommend this place for a quick, affordable, and satisfying meal."
