  "review": "I decided to try 17 Snyder Chinese for the first time, and while the food was decent, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The portions were generous, and the flavors were acceptable, but the overall quality felt a bit average. The delivery was quick, which was a plus, but I might explore other options next time."
