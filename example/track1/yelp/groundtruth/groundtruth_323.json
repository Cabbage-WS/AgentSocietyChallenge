  "review": "I had mixed feelings about my visit to Subway on E Fowler Ave in Tampa. While the staff member named Ms. Anika provided exceptional service and was very courteous, the overall experience was marred by the general inattentiveness and rudeness of the other staff. The cleanliness of the store was also concerning, and the quality of the food was inconsistent, with some ingredients seeming less fresh than they should be. Given my high standards for service and food quality, this visit fell short, and I doubt I'll return soon."
