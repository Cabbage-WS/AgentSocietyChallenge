  "review": "I visited Wendy's at 6441 E. 22nd St. in Tucson, and while the fast food joint had a few good points, it didn't align well with my preferences. The staff were friendly, and the place was clean, but the lack of a quiet and relaxing atmosphere made it less appealing. The food, while decent, was not as high-quality as I expected, and the lack of a diverse menu, especially for a Mexican food enthusiast like me, was a letdown. Additionally, the long wait times in the drive-thru and inside were frustrating, and the absence of a bar or good drinks was a significant minus. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick bite, but it doesn't meet my standards for a truly enjoyable dining experience."
