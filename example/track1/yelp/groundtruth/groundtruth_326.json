  "review": "I visited Chili's in Tampa, and while the idea of Tex-Mex and American classics sounded appealing, the experience fell short of my expectations. The service was notably slow, and the staff seemed inattentive, which made the dining experience less enjoyable. The food, while not terrible, lacked the high quality and consistency I usually look for. The outdoor seating area was clean, but the overall atmosphere was marred by the poor service. Given my preference for high-quality food and attentive service, I won't be returning to this location."
