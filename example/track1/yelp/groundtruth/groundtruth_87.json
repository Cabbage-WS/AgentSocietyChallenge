  "review": "I visited Lucky 7 Tavern hoping for a pleasant experience, but it fell short of my expectations. While the atmosphere was casual and the beer selection was good, the service was notably slow and inattentive. The food, particularly the fish tacos, was underwhelming and overpriced. The fact that they only accept cash was a significant inconvenience. Overall, the experience was disappointing, especially given the mixed reviews from other patrons, which I now understand. I would think twice before returning."
