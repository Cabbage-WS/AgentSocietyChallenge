  "review": "Atlantis, The Lost Bar is a unique spot with a laid-back vibe that aligns with my preference for casual, friendly environments. The bar is known for its affordable and fresh beer, which is a plus, and the community feel is welcoming. However, the lack of food service and the occasional crowding during busy nights are drawbacks. While the staff is generally friendly, a few gruff interactions have been noted, which can detract from the experience. Overall, it's a good place to unwind, but it doesn't fully hit all my favorite aspects like high-quality food and a consistently pleasant atmosphere."
