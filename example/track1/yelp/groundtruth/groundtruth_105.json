  "review": "Jones has a charming 70s-inspired decor and a cozy atmosphere, which I found quite appealing. The menu offers a variety of comfort food options, and the chicken and waffles were particularly delicious. However, the service was a bit hit-or-miss; while our server was friendly, the overall attention and efficiency were lacking at times. Additionally, the prices seemed a bit steep for the quality of some dishes, like the cheeseburger, which was underwhelming. Despite these issues, it's a decent spot for a casual dinner or weekend brunch, but there's room for improvement in service and consistency."
