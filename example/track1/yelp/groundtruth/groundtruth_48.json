  "review": "I visited You Say When Yogurt Shoppe expecting a fun and refreshing experience, but it fell short. The yogurt flavors were bland and lacked variety, and the service was unimpressive. While the toppings selection was decent, the overall experience wasn't worth the price. I hope they improve in the future."
