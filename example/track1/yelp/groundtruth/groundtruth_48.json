  "review": "I visited Goodness Fresh Food and Juice Bar with high hopes for a healthy and refreshing meal. The food was indeed delicious and fresh, especially the acai bowls and smoothies, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming, and the outdoor seating was a plus. However, the customer service was a letdown. I experienced long wait times and a few minor errors with my order, which was frustrating. Additionally, the noise level was a bit high, making it difficult to have a relaxed dining experience. While the food quality is commendable, the service and ambiance issues prevent me from giving a higher rating. I would consider returning, but these aspects need improvement."
