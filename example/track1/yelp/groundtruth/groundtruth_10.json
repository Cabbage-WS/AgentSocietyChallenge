The food quality is top-notch, especially the pastries and baked goods, which are fresh and delicious. The service is generally friendly and attentive, making the dining experience enjoyable. However, the place can get crowded, and the limited seating might be a drawback during peak hours. Despite these minor issues, the overall experience is very positive, and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family."
