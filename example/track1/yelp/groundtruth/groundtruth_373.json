  "review": "Heroes and Villains is a decent comic book store, offering a good selection of new comics and trade paperbacks. The staff is generally friendly and knowledgeable, which is a plus. However, I found the selection of back issues to be quite limited, which was disappointing. The store's rewards programs and community events are nice touches, but the occasional pretentiousness of some staff members can be off-putting. Overall, it's a solid choice for comic enthusiasts, but it could improve in a few areas."
