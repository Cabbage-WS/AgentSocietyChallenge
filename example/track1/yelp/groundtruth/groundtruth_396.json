  "review": "\"Growler's Taphouse offers a unique and enjoyable experience with a wide selection of beers and a solid menu. The prohibition-themed decor and live music add a nice touch, making it a great spot for a casual night out. However, the service can be hit or miss, with some staff being attentive while others are inattentive. The seating, especially the high bar stools, can be uncomfortable, and the prices are a bit steep for the quality of food. Overall, it's a decent place with some standout features, but it could use some improvements in service and pricing to fully meet my expectations.\""
