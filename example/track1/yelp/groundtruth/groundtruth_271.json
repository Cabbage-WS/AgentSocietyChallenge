  "review": "I had a fantastic experience at Goldie! The falafel was crispy and flavorful, and the pita bread was soft and chewy, just as I love it. The Tehina shakes and shawarma fries were a delightful surprise, adding a unique twist to the menu. The service was quick and friendly, making it a perfect spot for a quick, satisfying meal. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming, and I appreciated the attention to detail in the food preparation. Highly recommend!"
