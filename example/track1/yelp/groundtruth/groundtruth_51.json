  "review": "I recently visited Sundaze Yogurt and was thoroughly impressed. The frozen yogurt was delicious, with a wide variety of flavors and toppings to choose from. The staff, Wendy and Peter, were incredibly friendly and made the experience even more enjoyable. The shop was clean and welcoming, and the prices were reasonable. While I prefer self-serve options, the attentive service more than made up for it. This place is a hidden gem in Tucson!"
