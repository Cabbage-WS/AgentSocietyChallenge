  "review": "I visited this Starbucks near the Civic Center in Philadelphia, and while it's a convenient location, especially for those visiting nearby hospitals, my experience fell short of expectations. The service was slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed, leading to a long wait time even during a less busy period. The quality of the drinks was inconsistent, and I found the atmosphere to be less inviting compared to other Starbucks locations. Given my preference for quick service and a pleasant environment, this visit was somewhat disappointing."
