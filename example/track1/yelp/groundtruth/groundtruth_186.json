  "review": "I visited Westshore Pizza in Tampa and had a mixed experience. The pizza itself was decent, with a thin crust and a good selection of toppings. However, the service was subpar, with the staff seeming disengaged and not attentive to customer needs. There were also issues with the order accuracy, which is a significant concern. The atmosphere was clean and casual, but the long wait times for both seating and food diminished the overall experience. Given my past experiences, I value good service and efficient order handling, which were lacking here."
