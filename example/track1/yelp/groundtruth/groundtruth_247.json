  "review": "I visited Strudelking and was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the food and the friendly service. The strudels were large and delicious, making them a great value for the price. The owner was knowledgeable and provided helpful recommendations, enhancing the overall experience. While the preparation of the strudels from refrigerated storage could be improved, the overall authenticity and taste of the German specialties are top-notch. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a taste of Germany in Tampa."
