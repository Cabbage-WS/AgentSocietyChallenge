  "review": "I visited Bain's Deli for a quick lunch, and while the experience was mixed, it was generally satisfactory. The sandwiches were fresh and tasty, with a good variety of options, which aligns with my appreciation for quality food. The staff was friendly and the service was quick, which is a plus. However, the prices were a bit steep, and I did notice some slow service during peak hours. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick, casual lunch, but the higher prices and occasional service issues keep it from being a top pick for me."
