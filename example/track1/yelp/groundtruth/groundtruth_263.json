  "review": "I visited \"Uncle Tomy's\" for a quick lunch, hoping for a satisfying meal. While the delivery was prompt, the food quality was hit or miss. The wings were tasty, but the chicken tenders were dry and overcooked. The service was friendly, but the prices were a bit steep for the quality received. I also noticed some hygiene concerns, which is a major turn-off. Overall, it's a decent option for a quick bite, but it falls short of my expectations for a truly great dining experience."
