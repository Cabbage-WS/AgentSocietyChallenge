  "review": "Mike's Garage & Auto Repair is a reliable and honest auto shop in Tampa. The staff, especially Mike and his daughter Liz, are very friendly and provide detailed explanations of the necessary repairs, which I found reassuring. The pricing is fair and competitive, and the service is quick and efficient. While I haven't had extensive interactions with them, the few times I've visited, I've been impressed by their professionalism and the personal touch of being a family-owned business. However, I've heard a few mixed reviews, so I'll keep an eye on that in the future. Overall, a solid choice for automotive needs."
