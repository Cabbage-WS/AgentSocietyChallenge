  "review": "I visited Majestik Tattoo & Body Piercing for a consultation, and while the artists were professional and the facility was clean, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The atmosphere felt a bit cold and clinical, which was a stark contrast to the warm and personal experience I usually enjoy. Additionally, the valet parking was a nice touch, but the overall service didn't leave a lasting positive impression. I appreciate the attention to detail, but it wasn't enough to outweigh the lack of warmth and personal touch."
