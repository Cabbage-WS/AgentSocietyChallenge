  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "Moe's Southwest Grill offers a pleasant and welcoming atmosphere with clean facilities and friendly staff, which aligns with my preferences. The food, particularly the queso and salsa bar, is tasty and fresh, and the prices are reasonable. However, the service can be inconsistent, especially with online orders, and the menu can be confusing. These issues, along with occasional long wait times, prevented me from giving a higher rating. Overall, it's a decent option for a quick, affordable meal, but there's room for improvement in service consistency."
