  "review": "Marios Trattoria And Bar has a lot to offer, especially for those who appreciate authentic Italian cuisine. The food quality is generally high, and the pizza is a standout, often praised by other reviewers. However, the service can be inconsistent, with some visits being more positive than others. While the atmosphere is clean and welcoming, it might not be as romantic or upscale as one might hope for a special occasion. The prices are a bit on the higher side, and the portions could be more generous. Overall, it's a decent choice for Italian food, but it doesn't quite hit all the marks that I value most in a dining experience."
