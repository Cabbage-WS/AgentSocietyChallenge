  "review": "I recently visited Sonrisa Old City Dental, and I must say, it was an excellent experience. The practice is in-network with insurance, which is a huge plus for me. The staff, including Dr. Velez and Dr. Youngblood, were incredibly friendly and professional. They took the time to explain everything thoroughly and made me feel very comfortable. The office is modern, clean, and well-equipped, which added to the overall positive experience. I was particularly impressed by the efficiency and minimal wait times. While parking can be a bit of a challenge, it's a minor issue compared to the high-quality care I received. I highly recommend Sonrisa Old City Dental for anyone looking for top-notch dental services."
