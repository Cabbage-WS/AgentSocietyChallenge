  "review": "I visited Pet Supermarket in Tampa and had a mixed experience. The store is clean and has a good selection of quality pet products, which is a plus. However, the customer service was a bit hit-or-miss. Some staff members were friendly and knowledgeable, but others seemed unresponsive and unhelpful. The prices are a bit higher than I'd like, and the limited inventory for certain items was a downside. Overall, it's a decent place to shop, but there's room for improvement in service and pricing."
