  "review": "East Falls Beverage is a fantastic spot for beer and wine enthusiasts. The staff, particularly the owner John, are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, making the shopping experience both enjoyable and informative. The store offers a wide and diverse selection of beers, including craft brews and imports, which is perfect for someone looking to try new things. The products are always fresh and cold, and the community feel adds a welcoming touch. While parking can be a bit challenging, the overall experience more than makes up for it. Highly recommended!"
