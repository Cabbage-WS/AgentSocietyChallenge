  "review": "I had high hopes for Fiore Pizza based on the delicious food mentioned in other reviews, but my experience fell short. The pizza and stromboli were indeed tasty, but the service was lackluster and unresponsive to my concerns. I experienced long wait times and order mistakes, which are deal-breakers for me. While the prices were reasonable, the overall experience was frustrating and not worth the hassle."
