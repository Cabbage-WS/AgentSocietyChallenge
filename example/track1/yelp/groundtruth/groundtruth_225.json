  "review": "I visited Old Navy at 1001 Market St in Philadelphia, and while I appreciate the affordable prices and variety of sizes, my experience was quite disappointing. The store was disorganized and felt a bit dirty, which made shopping less enjoyable. The customer service was lackluster, with staff seeming indifferent and unhelpful. Although I found some decent deals, the overall quality of the clothing left something to be desired. It's a place to go for basic, budget-friendly items, but the poor atmosphere and service make it a hit-or-miss experience."
