  "review": "Martha is a charming spot with a unique and cozy atmosphere. The staff is friendly and attentive, making the experience enjoyable. The food, especially the sandwiches and pickled vegetables, is delicious, and the drink selection is excellent with a great variety of local beers and cocktails. While the food menu is a bit limited and the prices are on the higher side, the overall experience is worth it. I particularly enjoyed the outdoor bocce court and the relaxed ambiance. Highly recommended for a casual yet classy night out."
