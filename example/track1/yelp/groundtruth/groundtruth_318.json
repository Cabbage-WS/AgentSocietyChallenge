  "review": "Fishtown Pizza Truck brings a nostalgic touch to the neighborhood with its mobile setup, which is quite a unique and charming concept. The affordability of the pizza is a significant plus, and the convenience of having fresh slices delivered directly to my area is appreciated. However, the quality of the pizza is a bit hit-or-miss; it can feel more like a frozen pizza at times. The cash-only policy is also a minor inconvenience. Overall, it's a fun and affordable option, but not the best in terms of pizza quality."
