  "review": "I visited Pedata RV Center with high hopes, given their positive reviews, but my experience was quite disappointing. While the sales staff, like Mitch, were friendly and professional, the after-sales service was a significant letdown. My RV broke down shortly after purchase, and the dealership was unresponsive and unhelpful. The lack of reliable support and poor communication made me feel like the sale was the end of their interest in me as a customer. I would have preferred a more consistent and trustworthy service experience, especially for such a significant purchase."
