  "review": "I had a fantastic experience at Cali - South Tampa. The atmosphere is welcoming and has a nice, California-inspired vibe, which is a breath of fresh air in Tampa. The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive, making me feel right at home. The food was delicious, particularly the bowls, which were both flavorful and healthy. While the prices are a bit higher, the quality and service justify the cost. I\u2019m definitely planning to return and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great dining experience."
