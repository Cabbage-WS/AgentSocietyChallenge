  "review": "The Coronet is a charming and classically elegant spot with a unique and creative menu that offers a delightful dining experience. The service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere, both inside and on the patio, is truly special. However, I did notice some inconsistency in food quality, and the noise levels inside can be quite high, making it difficult to converse. Despite these minor issues, it's a place I would recommend for a special night out, especially for those who appreciate a sophisticated and well-crafted menu."
