  "review": "I visited Diamante Pizzaria hoping for a great dining experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. While the menu offers some diverse and tasty options, such as the Honey BBQ pizza and delicious breakfast items, the service and food quality were inconsistent. Several reviews mentioned long wait times, incorrect orders, and even food safety concerns, which are significant red flags. The atmosphere was pleasant, but the overall experience was marred by these issues. I would recommend this place with caution and suggest trying other local options first."
