  "review": "Bollywood Cafe & Grill is a pleasant discovery in Tampa, offering a delightful menu of authentic Indian dishes. The food is flavorful and well-prepared, with standout dishes like the lamb kabobs and butter chicken. The staff is friendly and accommodating, making the experience enjoyable despite the limited dine-in space. While the pricing is a bit higher than I'd prefer for a takeout spot, the quality and taste of the food make it worth the cost. The outdoor seating and casual atmosphere add to the charm, making it a good spot for a quick, satisfying meal."
