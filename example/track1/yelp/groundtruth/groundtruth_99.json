  "review": "Modo Mio Taverna is a charming Italian restaurant that truly delivered on my expectations. The food was outstanding, with the Agnolotti being a standout dish\u2014rich, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The service was attentive and friendly, with the staff going above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The cozy, rustic ambiance, both indoors and outdoors, added to the overall dining experience. While there were a few minor issues with wait times and portion sizes, they did not detract from the overall enjoyment. I would definitely recommend this place for a memorable Italian meal."
