While the outdoor seating and casual ambiance are nice, the service left a lot to be desired. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and it took a while to get our orders taken and food served. The food was decent but not exceptional, and it was a bit lukewarm by the time it arrived. I appreciate the casual and friendly atmosphere, but the service and food quality need improvement."
