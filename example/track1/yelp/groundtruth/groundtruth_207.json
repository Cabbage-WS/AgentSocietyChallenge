  "review": "Sandler's On 9th has a lot to offer, with its excellent food quality and friendly staff. The bacon fried rice and chicken and waffles were standout dishes, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. However, the service can be quite slow, which was a bit of a letdown. The inconsistency in food quality and the occasional overpriced dishes also left something to be desired. Overall, it's a good place to visit, but there's room for improvement in service speed and consistency."
