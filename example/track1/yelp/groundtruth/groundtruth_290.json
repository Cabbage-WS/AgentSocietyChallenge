  "review": "I had mixed feelings about my experience at the National Bank of Arizona. While the staff were generally friendly and professional, which is a plus, I encountered some significant issues with account management. The process of resolving a fee dispute was frustrating and time-consuming, and the bank's customer service was less than satisfactory. Given the importance of reliable and efficient service in a bank, these shortcomings were a major letdown. I would recommend this bank with caution, especially for those who value seamless account management and responsive customer support."
