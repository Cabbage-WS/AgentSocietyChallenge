  "review": "I visited Falafel Time and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, especially the fresh and flavorful falafel. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was clean and welcoming, despite the limited seating. However, the prices felt a bit high for a takeout place, and the pita could have been more fresh. Overall, it's a solid option for Mediterranean cuisine, but it didn't quite hit the mark in terms of value and consistency."
