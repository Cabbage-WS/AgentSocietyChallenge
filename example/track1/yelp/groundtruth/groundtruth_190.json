  "review": "I decided to try ATL Wings based on the mixed reviews, and my experience was decent but not outstanding. The wings were flavorful, especially the lemon pepper, but the portion sizes felt a bit small for the price. The service was friendly, but the place could use some improvements in cleanliness and organization. Overall, it's an okay spot if you're in the area, but I might look elsewhere for better value and ambiance."
