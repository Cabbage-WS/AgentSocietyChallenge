  "review": "I recently visited AMS Salon, and I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of service and the expertise of the stylists. The staff, particularly Megan and Tasha, were incredibly talented and provided a personalized experience that made me feel like a million dollars. The salon is clean and welcoming, and the attention to detail in my hair coloring and styling was exceptional. Despite a few minor parking issues, the overall experience was outstanding, and I would highly recommend AMS Salon to anyone looking for a top-notch hair salon in Philadelphia."
