  "review": "Izakaya By Yanaga offers a cozy and modern atmosphere that aligns well with my preference for a great dining experience. The food, particularly the sushi and sashimi, is top-notch and fresh, which is a must for me. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall experience. However, the noise level can be a bit high, making it challenging to converse, and some sushi rolls are a bit overpriced. Despite these minor issues, I would definitely come back and recommend it to friends."
