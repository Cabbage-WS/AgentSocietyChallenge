  "review": "Fitzwater Street Philly Bagels has a lot of potential with its fresh, high-quality bagels and friendly staff. However, the long wait times and occasional service inconsistencies are frustrating. The lack of outdoor seating and the overpriced items, especially those with lox, are also significant drawbacks. While the bagels are generally good, the overall experience doesn't quite meet my expectations for a consistently enjoyable visit."
