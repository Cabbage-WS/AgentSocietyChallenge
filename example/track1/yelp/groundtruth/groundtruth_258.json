  "review": "I had a very disappointing experience at Best Buy Furniture. Despite the positive reviews about efficient service and high-quality products, my interaction was marred by poor customer service. The staff, particularly during my store visits, were unprofessional and unhelpful. I also faced significant delays in receiving my order, with no clear communication about the status. This has significantly impacted my trust and loyalty, and I do not plan to return."
