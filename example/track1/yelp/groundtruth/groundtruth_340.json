  "review": "I had a fantastic experience at Millions Crab Boiled Seafood. The food was absolutely delicious, especially the shrimp and lobster, which were fresh and bursting with flavor. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making the visit even more enjoyable. The restaurant was clean and had a fun, hip-hop vibe that added to the overall atmosphere. While the prices were a bit on the higher side, the quality and service made it worth it. I would definitely recommend this place for a special night out or a fun dining experience with friends."
