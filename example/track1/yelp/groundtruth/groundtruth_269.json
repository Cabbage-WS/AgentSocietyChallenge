  "review": "Cellini is a hidden gem in Tampa, offering some of the best Italian food I've had in a while. The pizza, especially the Country with sundried tomatoes and goat cheese, is absolutely delicious. The Rigatoni Vodka is another standout, with a rich and creamy sauce that's hard to beat. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, making it great value for money. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, and the staff are friendly and accommodating. Despite a few mentions of slow service, the overall experience is fantastic, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine."
