  "review": "I recently visited Casual Male XL and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The staff, particularly Thomas and Pattie, were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, making the shopping experience very enjoyable. The store offers a wide range of sizes, which is great for finding the perfect fit. While it doesn't align with my usual preference for health and fitness stores with healthy food options, the excellent customer service and quality products make it a worthwhile visit. However, I did notice a small selection in certain categories, which could be improved. Overall, a solid choice for men's clothing."
