  "review": "I visited The Flavor Spot in Philadelphia and had a mixed experience. The jerk chicken and curry goat were indeed flavorful and juicy, which is a plus for any Caribbean restaurant. However, the side dishes, particularly the mac and cheese, were a letdown, being quite bland and not up to par. The staff was generally friendly, but there were moments of inconsistency. The place was clean and had a cozy atmosphere, but the limited menu availability and the fact that they only accept cash were minor inconveniences. Overall, it's a decent spot with some great hits and a few misses."
