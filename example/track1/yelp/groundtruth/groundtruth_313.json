  "review": "I visited Classic Spaghetti Western Steakhouse with some skepticism, given the mixed reviews. While the Western-themed decor and casual atmosphere were intriguing, the experience fell short of my expectations. The service was inconsistent, with some attentive moments but also notable delays and inattentiveness. The food, particularly the steaks, was overcooked and lacked the Euro-Turkish flair I enjoy in unique dining experiences. The noise level and poor acoustics made conversation challenging, and the cleanliness of the table and dishes left much to be desired. Overall, the value for money was not great, and I found it hard to justify the prices for the quality received. I appreciate the concept, but it needs significant improvements to win me over."
