  "review": "I visited Tommy's Place for breakfast and had mixed feelings about the experience. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy, but the food quality was inconsistent. My order arrived quickly, but the taste was just average, and some items seemed undercooked. While it\u2019s a decent spot for a quick meal, it didn\u2019t quite live up to the positive reviews I\u2019ve heard from others."
