  "review": "I visited Wawa hoping for a quick and convenient meal, but my experience was far from satisfactory. The store was poorly maintained, and the presence of homeless individuals and intoxicated customers made me feel unsafe. The service was slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed. The sandwiches were nothing special, and the overall atmosphere was unclean and unwelcoming. I won't be returning to this location."
