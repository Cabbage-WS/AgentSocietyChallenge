  "review": "The WingHouse Bar & Grill has a lively atmosphere and decent food, but the service can be hit or miss. I enjoyed the wings and the sports bar vibe, but the slow service and occasional disorganization left me feeling underwhelmed. It's a good spot for a casual outing, but don't expect top-notch service."
