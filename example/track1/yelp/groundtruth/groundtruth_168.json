  "review": "I visited Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen on Cottman Ave, and while the food had its moments, the overall experience was quite disappointing. The chicken was indeed tasty and seasoned well, which is a plus, but the service was painfully slow and the staff seemed uninterested in customer satisfaction. The place also felt a bit dated and could use some cleaning. I appreciate their delivery and take-out options, but the inconsistency in food quality, with some items being dry and small, makes it hard to recommend."
