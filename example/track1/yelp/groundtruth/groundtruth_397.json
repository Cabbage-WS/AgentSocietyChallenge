  "review": "Red Dog Bar & Grill is a great neighborhood spot with a laid-back vibe. The service is friendly, and the bar food is surprisingly good for a casual setting. I enjoyed the outdoor seating and the variety of games available to play. Definitely a place to relax and hang out with friends."
