  "review": "I visited this Subway in Philadelphia and found the experience to be quite disappointing. While the place was clean and the atmosphere was fine, the service was lackluster. The staff seemed disengaged and unprofessional, with one employee even using their phone while working. The food itself was average, with a lack of fresh vegetables and a generally uninspired taste. Given the issues with service and food quality, I can't recommend this location highly."
