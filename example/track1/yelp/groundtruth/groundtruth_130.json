  "review": "Cigar City CrossFit is a fantastic gym that aligns well with my preferences for a welcoming and community-focused environment. The coaches are incredibly knowledgeable and supportive, making every member, regardless of fitness level, feel comfortable and engaged. The gym is spacious and well-equipped, with a strong emphasis on safety and proper form. Although it's not kid-friendly and by-appointment-only, these aspects are minor drawbacks for me. The community here is truly special, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a supportive and motivating fitness environment."
