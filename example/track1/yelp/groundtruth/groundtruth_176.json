  "review": "I visited Wendy's during a busy lunch hour, and the experience was quite disappointing. The line was long, and the service was slow despite there being multiple staff members. My order was incorrect, and the food was lukewarm when I finally received it. I expected better from a fast-food chain, especially during peak hours."
