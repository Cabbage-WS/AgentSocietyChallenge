  "review": "E & J Pizza has some great things going for it, especially the fresh and delicious Margarita Pizza. The fast delivery and affordable prices are also a plus. However, the service can be hit or miss. I experienced long wait times and an incorrect order, which were frustrating. While the food was generally good, these service issues prevented me from giving a higher rating. E & J Pizza has the potential to be a favorite, but they need to improve their communication and order accuracy."
