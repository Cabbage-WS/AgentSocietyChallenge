  "review": "I had high hopes for this KFC, but my experience was disappointing. The service was slow and the staff seemed unresponsive and unfriendly, even during a relatively quiet time. The food was greasy and overcooked, far from the high-quality meals I usually enjoy. The restaurant was also quite dirty, which was off-putting. I value a clean and pleasant dining environment, and this KFC fell short on all fronts. I won't be returning."
