  "review": "I decided to give Barnet Fair a try, but unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. The stylists were praised by others, but my experience was far from positive. My brows were shaped poorly, and the customer service was lacking. I felt rushed and undervalued, and the overall atmosphere didn't make me feel comfortable. Given my past experiences, I won't be returning."
