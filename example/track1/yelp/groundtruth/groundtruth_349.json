  "review": "Visited Termini Bros Bakery and was impressed by the freshness and quality of their pastries, especially the cannoli, which were creamy and perfectly balanced. The staff was friendly, and the variety of options was great. However, the prices were a bit steep, which is a minor drawback. Overall, it's a good spot for a treat, but you might want to check the prices first."
