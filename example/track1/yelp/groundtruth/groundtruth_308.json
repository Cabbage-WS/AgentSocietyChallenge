  "review": "I visited Ming River Side Walk House, and while the food was flavorful and authentic, the experience was marred by several issues. The service was notably poor, with staff being unhelpful and even rude at times. Additionally, I was overcharged on my bill, which is a significant concern. The no-frills atmosphere and affordable prices were a plus, but the customer service issues and overcharging make it difficult to recommend this place. I appreciate a good value, but not at the cost of being treated poorly."
