  "review": "Plato Latino is a hidden gem in Tampa, offering a delightful Latin American dining experience. The Cuban sandwiches and roast pork are absolutely delicious, and the cafe con leche is a perfect complement to the meal. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, making the atmosphere cozy and welcoming. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, which is a plus. While there are a few minor inconsistencies mentioned in other reviews, the overall experience is well worth it. Highly recommend for anyone looking for authentic and delicious Latin cuisine."
