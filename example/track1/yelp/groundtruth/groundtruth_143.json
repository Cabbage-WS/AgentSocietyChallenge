  "review": "I visited 12th Street Cantina during a busy day at Reading Terminal Market. The chicken mole burrito I ordered was decent, but it lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for. The service was quick, which was appreciated, but the overall experience was just average. I might try it again, but there are better options in the market."
