  "review": "Brunchery Restaurant & Catering offers a cozy and welcoming atmosphere with friendly and attentive staff, which I really appreciated. The food, especially the French toast and corned beef hash, was delicious and made with fresh ingredients. However, the long wait times during peak hours and the occasional inconsistency in food quality did dampen the experience slightly. Overall, it's a nice place for a relaxed brunch, but there's room for improvement in terms of efficiency and consistency."
