However, the lack of toasters was a letdown, as it affected the texture of the bagels, making them a bit too hard. Additionally, the long wait times during peak hours were frustrating, and the limited seating made it challenging to enjoy a leisurely meal. While the quality of the food and the cozy atmosphere are commendable, these issues prevented me from having a fully enjoyable experience."
