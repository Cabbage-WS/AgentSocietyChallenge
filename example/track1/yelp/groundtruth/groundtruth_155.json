  "review": "I had a mixed experience at PJ Dolan's. The atmosphere was cozy, and the staff was friendly, but the food quality was inconsistent. I tried the shepherd's pie, which was decent but not outstanding. Overall, it's a decent spot for a casual drink, but I expected more from the Irish pub experience."
