  "review": "Palazzo Pizza offers a delightful dining experience with its delicious and high-quality pizza, especially the crispy crust and fresh ingredients. The staff is friendly and attentive, making the visit enjoyable. The clean and welcoming atmosphere, coupled with late hours of operation, adds to its appeal. However, there are a few reported issues with food quality and service that slightly dampen the overall experience. Despite these minor drawbacks, I highly recommend giving Palazzo Pizza a try."
