  "review": "I visited Kelly's Seafood with some friends, and while the place has its merits, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. The seafood, particularly the king crab legs, was fresh and decent, but the overall food quality was inconsistent. Some dishes were overcooked and lacked flavor, which was a letdown. The service was friendly, especially from the bartenders, but the long wait times and occasional inattentiveness were frustrating. The decor is definitely outdated and could use a refresh. While it's a good spot for a casual family dinner, it didn't live up to my expectations for a high-quality seafood experience."
