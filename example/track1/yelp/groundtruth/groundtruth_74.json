  "review": "I visited Friday Appliance Service T G I F for a repair, and while they do accept credit cards, which is a plus, the overall experience was quite disappointing. The business is not currently open, which was a significant inconvenience. The staff seemed disorganized, and there was no clear communication about the repair process or estimated times. Given my preference for businesses that are reliable and communicative, especially in the service industry, this place fell short of my expectations. I would recommend finding a more dependable appliance repair service."
