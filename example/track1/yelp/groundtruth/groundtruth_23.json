  "review": "I visited Pottery Barn with high hopes, but my experience was a major letdown. The store itself is beautiful, with high-quality and stylish products, but the customer service was abysmal. I was ignored for long periods, and when I did get assistance, the staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful. Additionally, I heard from other customers about significant delivery delays and issues with orders. Given my past experiences with poor service and inefficiency, Pottery Barn fails to meet even the most basic standards. I would not recommend this store."
