  "review": "I visited Party City on Dale Mabry Hwy in Tampa and had a mixed experience. While the store is well-organized and has a wide selection of party supplies and decorations, the quality of the items, especially the costumes, is quite disappointing. The prices are higher than expected, particularly for balloons and accessories. The customer service was inconsistent; some staff were helpful, but others were unengaged and unresponsive. Overall, it\u2019s a decent place for basic party needs, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for high-quality items or a consistently positive shopping experience."
