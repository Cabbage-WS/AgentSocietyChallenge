  "review": "I visited Grape Street on a Friday night, and while the atmosphere was lively, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The live music was decent, but the sound quality could have been better. The sticky floors and crowded bar added to the chaos, making it hard to fully enjoy the experience. Overall, it's a decent spot for a night out, but it's not somewhere I'd rush back to."
