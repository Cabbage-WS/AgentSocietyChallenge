  "review": "Tasty Shop is a delightful find in Tampa, offering a combination of delicious seafood and chicken wings that truly hit the spot. The wings are meaty, flavorful, and perfectly cooked, and the honey sriracha flavor is a standout. The staff is friendly and attentive, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. While the ambiance is more contemporary and classy rather than traditional, the overall quality of the food and service is exceptional. The prices are also very reasonable, making it a great value for the quality you get. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch meal in a pleasant setting."
