  "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Shiroi Hana. The sushi and sashimi were fresh and delicious, and the portion sizes were generous. The staff was friendly and attentive, which made the dining experience even better. The atmosphere was calm and quiet, perfect for a relaxing dinner. While some of the prices were a bit higher than I expected, the quality of the food justified the cost. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Japanese dining experience."
