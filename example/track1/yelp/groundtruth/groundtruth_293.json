  "review": "I had a mixed experience at Passport Health Tucson Travel Clinic. While the staff was knowledgeable and the appointment process was smooth, I found the prices to be quite high, and they didn't seem willing to work with my insurance. The hard sell approach also made me uncomfortable. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but I expected more flexibility and better customer service."
