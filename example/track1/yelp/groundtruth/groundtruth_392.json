  "review": "I visited Tucson Strength with high hopes after reading the positive reviews, but unfortunately, it didn't align with my preferences. While the gym has a supportive community and knowledgeable staff, which are great, I was put off by the contract issues and the difficulty in canceling services, a deal-breaker for me. The gym also seemed a bit crowded during peak times, which made the workout experience less enjoyable. I appreciate the variety of programs and equipment, but the potential for hidden costs and the lack of flexibility in contracts make it hard to recommend."
