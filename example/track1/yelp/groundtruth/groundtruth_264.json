  "review": "I recently visited Martin's Quality Meats & Sausage, and I must say, it was a delightful experience. The variety of sausages and meats is impressive, and the quality is top-notch. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, offering great recommendations. The prices are reasonable, which is a plus. However, I did notice one staff member handling both money and meat with the same gloves, which raised some hygiene concerns. Overall, a great place for meat lovers, but they could improve their food safety practices."
