  "review": "I visited Wendy's on Ridge Avenue, and while the food was decent, the overall experience was less than satisfactory. The service was slow, and I had to wait a significant amount of time for a simple order. The staff seemed disorganized and unfriendly, which is a major turn-off for me. The fries were good, and the Frosty was refreshing, but the long wait and poor service overshadowed the positives. Additionally, the restaurant's atmosphere was rather basic and lacked the pleasant ambiance I prefer. I would not recommend this location for a quick, enjoyable meal."
