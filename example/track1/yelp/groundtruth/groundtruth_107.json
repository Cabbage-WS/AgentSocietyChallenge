  "review": "I visited Empanadas & Arepas Factory and had a mixed experience. The food was tasty and affordable, with a variety of empanadas and arepas that were crispy and satisfying. The casual and relaxed atmosphere with outdoor seating was a nice touch. However, the staff was not as friendly as I would have liked, and there were concerns about the freshness of the food, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, it's a good place to try, but there's room for improvement."
