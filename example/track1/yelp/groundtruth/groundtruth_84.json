  "review": "I visited Adidas on a whim, hoping to find some good deals and a pleasant shopping experience. The store is indeed well-organized, and the staff were generally friendly and helpful, which is a plus. However, the lack of seating, especially in the shoe section, was a minor inconvenience. More concerning was an interaction with a staff member who seemed a bit unhelpful and somewhat rude when I asked about a price adjustment. While I did find some decent deals, the inconsistent customer service and the lack of seating prevent me from giving a higher rating. It's a mixed bag, but overall, it's an okay place to shop if you're looking for specific items."
