  "review": "The Curtis Center is a stunning venue with a rich history and breathtaking architecture. The Dream Garden mosaic is a true masterpiece and worth visiting on its own. While the space is ideal for events, I did notice some minor logistical issues during a recent wedding I attended. Overall, it's a beautiful and memorable place, though a few improvements could enhance the experience further."
