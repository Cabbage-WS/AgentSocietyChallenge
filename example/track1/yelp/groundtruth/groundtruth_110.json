  "review": "I visited Schenk's Family Bakery and had a mixed experience. While the strawberry shortcake and chocolate cream-filled donuts were delicious and the staff were friendly, some items, like the pound cake, were disappointingly dry. The prices were reasonable, and the variety was good, but the inconsistency in product quality and a few hygiene concerns gave me pause. Overall, it\u2019s a decent bakery, but there\u2019s room for improvement."
