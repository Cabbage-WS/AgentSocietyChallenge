  "review": "I visited Ritz East for a movie night, and while the place was clean and the staff was friendly, I felt the overall experience was a bit underwhelming. The cinema itself was modern and well-maintained, but the seating was a bit uncomfortable, and the sound quality could be better. It\u2019s a good spot for a casual outing, but it didn\u2019t quite meet my expectations for a 4.5-star venue. I\u2019d recommend it for a one-time visit, but I might look elsewhere for a more premium experience."
