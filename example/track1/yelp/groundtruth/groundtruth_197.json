  "review": "I had a terrible experience at this U-Haul location. The staff was unprofessional and rude, and the facility was poorly maintained. I reserved a truck online, but when I arrived, they tried to give me the wrong vehicle and made me wait for over an hour. The whole process was chaotic and frustrating. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
