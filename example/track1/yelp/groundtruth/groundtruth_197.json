  "review": "I visited Metropolitan Bakery and was impressed by the quality of their bread and pastries. The baguette and chocolate croissants were exceptional, and the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. However, I did hear some mixed reviews about the customer service at the Chestnut Hill location, which is a bit of a concern. Overall, it's a great place for high-quality baked goods, and I would definitely recommend it for a special treat, especially if you enjoy a variety of vegetarian options and a relaxed setting."
