  "review": "I approached Feretti Motors with a healthy dose of skepticism after my last disastrous experience with an auto shop. Unfortunately, my visit here did little to restore my faith. While the staff was polite, the service was lackluster, and I couldn't shake the feeling that they were trying to upsell me on unnecessary repairs. I value honesty and transparency, and this place fell short. I won't be returning."
