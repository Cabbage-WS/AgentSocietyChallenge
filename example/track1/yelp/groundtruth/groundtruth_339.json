  "review": "I visited Cappys Cafe and had a mixed experience. The food, especially the wings and crabs, was quite good and reasonably priced, which is a plus. However, the service was inconsistent and at times unprofessional, which significantly detracted from my visit. The atmosphere is generally relaxed and the place is good for a casual drink, but the long wait times and some unfriendly staff interactions made it hard to enjoy fully. I would recommend this place with caution, as the quality of your experience may vary."
