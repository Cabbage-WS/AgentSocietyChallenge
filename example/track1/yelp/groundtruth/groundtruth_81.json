  "review": "I visited ICandy a few weeks ago with some friends and had a mixed experience. The place has a lively atmosphere, which is great for a night out, and the free dance floor on the second level was a nice touch. However, the service was quite lackluster. We had to wait a long time to get drinks, and the staff seemed inattentive. Additionally, the venue was very crowded and hot, which made it uncomfortable. The most concerning issue was the reported discrimination, which is a major red flag for me. I appreciate businesses that are welcoming to everyone, and ICandy fell short in this regard. While there are some positive aspects, the negatives outweigh them, making it hard to recommend."
