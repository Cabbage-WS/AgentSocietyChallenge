  "review": "I visited Adsum Restaurant and while the food was somewhat creative, it fell short in several areas that are important to me. The service was inconsistent, with some staff being attentive but others seeming inattentive. The noise level was quite high, making it difficult to enjoy a conversation. Moreover, the portion sizes were small and overpriced, which is a dealbreaker for me. The unique atmosphere and some dishes, like the foie gras poutine, were enjoyable, but the overall experience was marred by these issues. I found it similar to my previous experiences with places that often get orders wrong or have payment issues."
