  "review": "Frank's Sandwich Shop is a hidden gem with hearty, no-frills meals that remind me of home-cooked comfort food. The monster burger is a must-try, and the fast service is impressive. While the place is small and simple, it has a welcoming, down-to-earth vibe that makes it feel like a local treasure."
