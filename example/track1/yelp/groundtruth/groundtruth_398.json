  "review": "I visited Arizona Bug Doctor for pest control services, and my experience was mixed. On the positive side, the technicians were knowledgeable and thorough, which is important when dealing with pests. However, scheduling the appointment was a bit of a challenge, and the office staff could be more responsive. The limited hours of operation were also inconvenient. Overall, the service was effective, but there's room for improvement in customer service and flexibility."
