  "review": "Lee's Hoagie House is a casual spot with a variety of sandwiches, and I can see why it's a Philly staple. The hoagies are indeed big and packed with high-quality meat, which is a plus. The staff is generally friendly and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for the portion sizes. However, the bread quality can be hit or miss\u2014sometimes it's too soft, which detracts from the overall experience. Additionally, there have been a few instances of service inconsistencies, like incorrect orders or longer wait times for delivery. Overall, it's a decent place, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of my favorite sandwich spots."
