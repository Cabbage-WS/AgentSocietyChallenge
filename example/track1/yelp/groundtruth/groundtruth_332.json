  "review": "I visited Pine St Deli for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The service was friendly and attentive, which made the experience enjoyable. The sandwiches were delicious, especially the hoagie, which was packed with fresh and flavorful ingredients. The prices were very reasonable, making it a great value for the quality of food. While the atmosphere is a bit dim and the seating is limited, it didn't detract from the overall experience. A cash-only policy might be a minor inconvenience, but an ATM is available. Overall, a solid choice for a quick and satisfying meal."
