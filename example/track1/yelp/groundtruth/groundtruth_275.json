  "review": "I visited Kneaders Bakery & Cafe and found it to be a mixed experience. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming, and the staff was friendly and attentive, which I appreciated. The menu offered a variety of options, including some healthy choices. However, the long wait times and slightly overpriced items were a bit of a letdown. Additionally, I noticed some inconsistencies in food quality, which affected my overall experience. Despite these drawbacks, I still enjoyed my visit and would consider coming back for a quick bite or a special treat."
