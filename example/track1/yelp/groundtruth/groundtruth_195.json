  "review": "I visited Tire Kingdom for a routine tire repair and was thoroughly disappointed. The service was unreliable, with incorrect repairs that caused further issues. The staff was aggressive in trying to upsell unnecessary services, and there was a lack of transparency about the work being done. The waiting area was clean, but this minor positive was far outweighed by the poor quality of service and unprofessional behavior. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
