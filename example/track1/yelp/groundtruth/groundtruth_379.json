  "review": "I visited Abuelitas Taqueria with some friends, hoping for a delicious and authentic Mexican dining experience. While the menu offered a variety of traditional dishes, the service was somewhat lacking. The staff was friendly but not particularly attentive, and the atmosphere was quite casual, which didn't align with my preference for a more refined dining experience. The food was decent, but the flavors were not as exceptional as I had hoped, and there were no homemade condiments to enhance the dishes. Overall, it was a mediocre experience that didn't quite meet my expectations."
