  "review": "I visited Macayo's Mexican Kitchen with high hopes for a great dining experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. While the atmosphere was clean and comfortable, and some dishes like the chimichangas were enjoyable, the service was noticeably lacking. The waitstaff was inattentive, and the food took a long time to arrive. Additionally, the prices seemed a bit high for the quality of the food, which was sometimes bland and not as well-prepared as I had hoped. I appreciate the restaurant's long-standing tradition in the community, but there's definitely room for improvement in both service and consistency."
