  "review": "I visited Abuelitas Taqueria during a trip to Casino Del Sol and had mixed feelings about the experience. The tacos were decent, but the portions were quite small, which was disappointing. The staff was friendly, but the overall quality didn't quite meet my expectations. It's a decent option if you're in the casino, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."
