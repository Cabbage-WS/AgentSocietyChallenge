  "review": "I visited Great Clips Encore Commons for a haircut and was disappointed with the overall experience. The staff was friendly, and the service was quick, which are positives. However, the quality of the haircut was poor, and it was uneven, requiring me to fix it myself. This is a significant issue, especially when I expect a professional and consistent service. The salon also had some issues with the online check-in system, leading to a bit of confusion and a longer wait than expected. While the price was reasonable, the quality did not match my expectations, making it a less favorable experience overall."
