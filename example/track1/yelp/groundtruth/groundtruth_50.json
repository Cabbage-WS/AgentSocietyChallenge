  "review": "I visited La Giraldilla Hanley Inc with some reservations, given my past experiences with long wait times and poor service. Unfortunately, my visit confirmed some of these concerns. While the food was decent and the Cuban dishes were authentic, the service was slow and inattentive, and the wait for our meal was quite long. The ambiance was pleasant, but the cleanliness of the establishment left something to be desired. Given the mixed reviews, I can't recommend this place without hesitation."
