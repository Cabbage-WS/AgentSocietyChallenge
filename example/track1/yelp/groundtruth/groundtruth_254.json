  "review": "I visited La Casa de Pan de Yuca, and it was a pleasant surprise. The bread, especially the pan de yuca and cheese rolls, was incredibly fresh and delicious. The owner, Teresa, was warm and welcoming, making the experience even better. The prices were very reasonable, which is a huge plus. Although the selection is limited and the space is small, the quality of the products more than makes up for it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic and delicious Latin American bread."
