  "review": "I visited the Fountain Restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia, and while the ambiance was sophisticated and the service was generally attentive, I found the experience to be a bit overpriced. The food was exquisite, especially the seafood and desserts, but some dishes were hit or miss, which was disappointing given the high standards set by the restaurant. The valet parking was convenient but added to the overall cost. Despite these drawbacks, the professional and courteous service made the visit enjoyable, though I would have preferred a more consistent dining experience."
