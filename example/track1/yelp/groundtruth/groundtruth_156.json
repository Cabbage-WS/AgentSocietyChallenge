  "review": "My experience at La Parrilla Suiza was a mixed bag. The food was generally good, with some standout dishes like the enchiladas and tortilla soup, which were both flavorful and well-prepared. The staff was friendly and attentive, which made the dining experience enjoyable. However, the service was a bit slow, and there were a few cleanliness issues in the restroom that were disappointing. Overall, it's a decent place to try authentic Mexican cuisine, but there's room for improvement in terms of consistency and service speed."
