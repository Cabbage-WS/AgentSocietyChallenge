  "review": "I decided to try Fiore Pizza based on its proximity to my home. The pizza was decent, with a good balance of toppings, but the crust was a bit too thick for my liking. The staff was friendly, and the delivery was quick, which was a plus. Overall, it's a solid neighborhood spot, but I've had better pizza elsewhere."
