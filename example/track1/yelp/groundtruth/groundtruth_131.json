  "review": "I had a fantastic experience at Arizona Growers! The staff, particularly Ben and Adam, were incredibly friendly and helpful, which made my visit truly enjoyable. The nursery is beautifully maintained, and the variety of healthy, well-cared-for plants is impressive. Although it's a smaller nursery, the quality and selection more than make up for it. The prices are fair, and the overall atmosphere is warm and inviting. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great gardening experience."
