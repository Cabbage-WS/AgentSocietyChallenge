The service was friendly and efficient, which made the dining experience enjoyable. However, the atmosphere was a bit disappointing\u2014drab and gloomy, which detracted from the overall experience. Additionally, the portion sizes were smaller than expected for the price. While I would recommend this place for the food and service, there's room for improvement in the ambiance and value."
