  "review": "I visited Brick And Bell and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee and pastries. The espresso was smooth and rich, and the cinnamon roll was incredibly fresh and delicious. The staff were friendly and attentive, making the experience even better. The cafe itself is clean and has a modern, welcoming vibe. However, I did find the seating to be a bit limited and not very comfortable, which might affect the overall stay. Additionally, the location is not very obvious, which could be a downside for first-time visitors. Despite these minor issues, the reasonable prices and high-quality products make it a solid choice for a quick coffee or pastry fix."
