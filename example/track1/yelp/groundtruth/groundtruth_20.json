  "review": "The Flycatcher has a lot to offer, especially for a casual night out in Tucson. The atmosphere is cool and laid-back, with a nice outdoor patio that adds to the experience. The staff is generally friendly and attentive, and the drink prices are quite reasonable, which is a plus. However, the layout can be a bit challenging during busy events, and the karaoke DJ has been a hit-or-miss experience. While the bar has a lot of potential, these minor issues keep it from being a top pick for me."
