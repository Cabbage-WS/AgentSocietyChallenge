The staff was friendly and attentive, making the dining experience enjoyable. The restaurant has a clean and welcoming atmosphere, which added to the overall vibe. While the prices were a bit higher than expected, the quality and portion sizes justified the cost. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great Indian dining experience."
