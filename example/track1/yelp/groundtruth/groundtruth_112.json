  "review": "I recently had to use United Cab Company in Tampa, and the experience was far from satisfactory. The driver was over 30 minutes late, and the dispatcher was unhelpful when I called to check on the status. The taxi was dirty and poorly maintained, which was disappointing. The driver was also rude and unprofessional, making the ride even more unpleasant. Given the numerous negative reviews and my own experience, I would not recommend this company to anyone. There are much better options available in Tampa for reliable and friendly transportation."
