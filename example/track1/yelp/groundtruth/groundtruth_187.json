  "review": "Bruskin Hardware & Lock is a true gem in South Philly. The owner is incredibly knowledgeable and has an impressive inventory of hard-to-find items. I needed a specific key that no one else had, and they not only had it but also made it quickly. The service is friendly, and the atmosphere feels like stepping back in time to a simpler, more personal way of doing business. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for quality service and unique solutions."
