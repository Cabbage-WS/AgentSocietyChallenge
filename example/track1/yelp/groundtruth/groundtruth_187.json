  "review": "Paradiso offers a dining experience that is both elegant and enjoyable, with a menu that features high-quality Italian and Mediterranean dishes. The atmosphere is classy and inviting, making it a great spot for special occasions. However, the portion sizes are disappointingly small, and the prices are on the higher side, which can be a bit of a letdown. The service is generally attentive, but there have been instances of inconsistency. Overall, it's a solid choice, but it could improve in terms of value for money."
