  "review": "Pizza Famiglia has a lot going for it, with a friendly and reliable staff, clean and welcoming atmosphere, and some delicious food options, particularly the pizza and desserts. However, the long delivery times and occasional issues with food quality, such as cold or stale items, are significant drawbacks. The pricing is generally fair, but these inconsistencies make it a bit of a mixed bag. I appreciate the late-night availability, but the service and food quality need to be more consistent to truly stand out."
