  "review": "Hyde Park Dental has a mixed bag of experiences, which makes it a bit of a gamble. On the positive side, the office is clean and welcoming, and the staff are generally friendly and professional. Dr. Patrino is known for his gentle touch and high-quality dental work, which is reassuring. However, the inconsistent service and communication issues are significant drawbacks. I've heard from other patients about unprofessional behavior and billing problems, which are red flags for me. Overall, it's a decent dental practice, but it could definitely improve in terms of consistency and customer service."
