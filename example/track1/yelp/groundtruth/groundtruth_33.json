  "review": "I visited Eliz Mexican Restaurant & American Breakfast for a casual lunch, and while the experience was decent, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. The food was good, with fresh and flavorful Mexican dishes that stood out, especially the tacos. The service was friendly and attentive, which is always a plus. However, the decor felt a bit industrial and not very inviting, and there were a few issues with the cleanliness that detracted from the overall experience. The value for money was reasonable, but I've had better Mexican food in more pleasant settings. Overall, it's a decent spot, but not a place I'd return to frequently."
