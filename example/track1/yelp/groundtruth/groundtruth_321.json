  "review": "Burger 21 - Airside C offers a solid dining experience with friendly and accommodating staff, which is a big plus. The food is generally high-quality, with a variety of condiments that allow for customization. However, the lack of vegan options is a significant drawback for me. Additionally, the prices are on the higher side, and there are occasional issues with long wait times and inconsistent food preparation. Overall, it's a decent option for a quick airport meal, but it doesn't quite meet all my preferences."
