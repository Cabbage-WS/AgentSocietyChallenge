  "review": "I had a solid experience at Burger 21 during a layover at Tampa Airport. The burger was flavorful and the fries were crispy, which is always a win. The staff was friendly, and the quick service made it a convenient option for travelers. While the prices are a bit steep for airport food, the quality made it worth it."
