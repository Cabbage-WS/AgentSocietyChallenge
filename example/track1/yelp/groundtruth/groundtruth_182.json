  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "I visited Firetruck Brewing with some friends, and while the beer selection was indeed impressive, the overall experience was quite disappointing. The service was slow and inattentive, with our waitress seeming uninterested in our presence. The food, while not terrible, lacked the quality I expect for the price. The patio seating was nice, but the cleanliness of the tables was a concern. Given my high standards for service and food quality, I can't recommend this place highly."
