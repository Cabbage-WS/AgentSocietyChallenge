  "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Epic Cafe. The staff was friendly, and they accommodated my dietary restrictions with ease. The vegan options were a nice surprise, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. I would have given it 5 stars if the coffee had been a bit stronger, but overall, it was a great visit."
