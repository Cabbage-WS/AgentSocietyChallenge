  "review": "I visited Ashtanga Yoga Philadelphia and was impressed by the quality of the instruction and the welcoming community. The studio offers a genuine Ashtanga yoga experience, and the instructors, like David Garrigues and Elizabeth Sitzler, are highly knowledgeable and attentive. The environment is friendly and supportive, making it a great place for both beginners and experienced practitioners. While the building is a bit old and the parking can be challenging, these minor issues do not detract from the overall positive experience. Highly recommend for those looking for a top-notch yoga practice."
