  "review": "I recently had the pleasure of bringing my car to A & M Auto Body, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience. The owner, Mike, provided exceptional customer service, making the entire process smooth and stress-free. The quality of the repair was top-notch, and my car looked brand new. They were also very transparent about the costs and timeline, and even went the extra mile by cleaning the car inside and out. Highly recommend!"
