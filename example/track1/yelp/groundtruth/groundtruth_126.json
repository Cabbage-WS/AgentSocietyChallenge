  "review": "I had high hopes for Meritus Associations, but my experience was disappointing. The customer service was unprofessional and unresponsive, with issues never being properly addressed. The property management was incompetent, and the maintenance, especially the landscaping, was subpar. It's clear that the company does not prioritize the needs and concerns of its clients. I cannot recommend this business."
