  "review": "Jet Rock Bar and Grill has a few redeeming qualities, such as its reasonable prices and good breakfast options, which align with my preference for affordability. However, the poor service, subpar food quality, and long wait times are significant drawbacks. The staff's inattentiveness and the unappealing menu options, especially for a casual dining bar, are particularly disappointing. While the place is clean and comfortable, the overall experience did not meet my expectations, and I would not recommend it to others."
