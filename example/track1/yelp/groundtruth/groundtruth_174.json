  "review": "I had mixed feelings about my stay at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites Tampa - USF-Busch Gardens. The location is extremely convenient, especially for visiting Busch Gardens, and some staff members, particularly the shuttle drivers, were very helpful. However, the room quality was disappointing. The room was in need of maintenance, with a broken toilet and a lack of essential amenities. The cleanliness was also subpar, and the Wi-Fi was slow and unreliable. Considering the price, the value for money isn't great, and these issues significantly detracted from my overall experience."
