  "review": "I visited Chipotle Mexican Grill on East Cathedral Road and found the experience to be quite disappointing. The food quality was inconsistent, with some items being cold and lacking the freshness I expect. The service was slow and the staff seemed inattentive, which made the overall experience less enjoyable. While the place was clean, the atmosphere was not as lively or welcoming as I had hoped. Despite these issues, I did appreciate the option for takeout, which was convenient. However, I wouldn't recommend this location based on my visit."
