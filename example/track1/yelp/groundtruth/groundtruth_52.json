  "review": "I visited Girard Vetinary Clinic for my dog's annual check-up and was initially impressed by the affordable prices and the caring staff. However, the long wait times and the crowded waiting room were frustrating, especially for a nervous pet. The service quality was inconsistent, and I felt that the communication regarding costs and treatment options could have been better. While the staff was friendly, the overall experience didn't meet my expectations, and I would consider other options in the future."
