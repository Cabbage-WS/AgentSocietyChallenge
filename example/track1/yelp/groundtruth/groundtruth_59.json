The staff was friendly and the service was prompt. However, I was very concerned about the hygiene practices. One review mentioned that the staff did not wear gloves or masks, and this is a major red flag for me. Additionally, the portion sizes were a bit smaller than expected, which didn't provide the best value for the price. While I appreciate the taste and service, the hygiene issues are a deal-breaker, and I won't be returning."
