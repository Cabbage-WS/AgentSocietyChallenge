  "review": "I had a pleasant experience at Sabor a Merengue. The restaurant offers authentic Dominican cuisine with a variety of delicious options, which aligns well with my preference for high-quality dining. The staff was friendly and attentive, making the visit enjoyable. The food was fresh and flavorful, especially the mangu and sancocho, which were standouts. The casual and clean atmosphere was welcoming, and the prices were reasonable. However, I did notice a slight delay in service, which might be a point of improvement. Overall, it's a solid choice for those looking for a taste of the Dominican Republic in Tampa."
