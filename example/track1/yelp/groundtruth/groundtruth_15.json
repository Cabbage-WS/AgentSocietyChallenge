  "review": "Cuenelli's Peruvian Restaurant is a pleasant surprise, offering healthy and delicious food in a casual, welcoming atmosphere. The rotisserie chicken is moist and flavorful, and the sides like cilantro rice are a perfect complement. The staff is friendly and attentive, making the dining experience enjoyable. While it's not a food truck, the quality and taste of the food align well with my preferences. The only minor downside is that the chicken can occasionally be a bit dry, but overall, it's a great place to visit for a satisfying meal."
