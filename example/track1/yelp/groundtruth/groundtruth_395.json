  "review": "I had mixed feelings about my experience with I-75 Moving and Storage. On the positive side, the moving team was professional and handled my belongings with care, which is crucial during a move. They were also punctual and worked efficiently. However, the scheduling and communication issues were quite frustrating. I had to chase down the office multiple times to confirm my move date, and there were some last-minute changes that added unnecessary stress. While the actual moving experience was good, the lack of clear communication and the scheduling challenges made it a less-than-ideal overall experience."
