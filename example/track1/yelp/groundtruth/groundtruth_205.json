  "review": "I had a decent experience with I-75 Moving and Storage. The movers were professional and efficient, and they handled my belongings with care. However, there were a few minor hiccups with communication and timing, which slightly dampened the overall experience. Despite that, I would still recommend them for their hard work and dedication."
