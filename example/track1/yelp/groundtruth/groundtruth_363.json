  "review": "I had a disappointing experience at Krone's Auto Repair Specialists. The service was slow, and the communication was poor. I was initially quoted a price, but the final bill was significantly higher than expected. While the staff was polite, the overall experience left me feeling frustrated and unsure if I would return."
