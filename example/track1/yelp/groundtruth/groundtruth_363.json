  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "Washlava has some great features that align with what I value in a service business, such as its clean and modern facilities and the convenience of an app-based system for payment and reservations. However, the recurring issues with broken machines and occasional cleanliness problems are disappointing. While the 24/7 availability and generally helpful staff are appreciated, these negatives prevent me from giving a higher rating. I hope they address these issues to provide a more consistent and enjoyable experience."
