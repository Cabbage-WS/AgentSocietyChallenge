  "review": "London Heights British Pub has a lot going for it, with a fun and welcoming atmosphere that's perfect for a casual night out. The live music and multiple TVs for sports add to the pub's charm, making it a great spot for social gatherings. However, the food quality is hit-or-miss, with some dishes like the burgers being inconsistent. The service can also be slow at times, and the prices are a bit steep for the quality of food. Despite these drawbacks, the pub's overall vibe and friendly staff make it a decent choice, but it falls short of being a top pick for me."
