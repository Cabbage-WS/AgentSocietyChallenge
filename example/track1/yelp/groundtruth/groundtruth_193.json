  "review": "Maple Japanese Ramen is a delightful find in Philadelphia. The Akamaru Modem Ramen was exceptional, with a rich, savory broth and perfectly cooked noodles. The staff was friendly and attentive, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. The restaurant is clean and has a cozy, inviting atmosphere. While there were a few minor inconsistencies noted by some reviewers, the overall experience was excellent, and I would definitely return for more of their delicious ramen."
