  "review": "Joe Coffee Company has a great location right across from Rittenhouse Square, making it a perfect spot for people-watching. The coffee is decent, though not the best I've had, and the staff is friendly. It's a nice place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee while soaking in the lively atmosphere."
