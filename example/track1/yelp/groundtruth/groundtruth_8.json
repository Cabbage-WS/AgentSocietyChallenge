The food was decent, with some standout dishes like the buffalo wings and pretzel sticks. However, the prices were a bit steep, and I felt that some of the portions were on the smaller side, which didn't provide the best value for money. While it's a good spot for a casual night out, I wouldn't say it's worth the higher prices for the quality of food and service received."
