  "review": "I visited Peter Piper Pizza with my family, and while the pizza and salads were tasty and reasonably priced, the overall experience was quite disappointing. The place was quite noisy and chaotic, especially with the screaming children, which wasn't ideal for a relaxing meal. The bathrooms and tables were dirty, and several games were broken, which was a letdown for my kids. The staff seemed inattentive, and there were long wait times for food and prize redemption. While the food was good, the cleanliness and service issues made it a less enjoyable experience. I would recommend this place only if you can handle the chaos and don't mind the maintenance issues."
