  "review": "I visited Just Thai with some mixed expectations after reading a range of reviews. The service was indeed quick and efficient, and the atmosphere was clean and modern, which I appreciated. However, the food quality was hit-or-miss. While the Pad Thai was decent, it lacked the authenticity I was hoping for and seemed a bit Americanized. The portion sizes were also smaller than expected, which didn't feel like a great value for the price. Given my past experience with poor food quality and service, I was hoping for a more consistent and satisfying meal."
