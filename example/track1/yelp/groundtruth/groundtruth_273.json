  "review": "I had high hopes for Villa Bugambilias by MC Residential, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. The business is currently not open, which is a significant inconvenience. Additionally, the low rating from other users and the lack of positive reviews suggest that the service and quality do not meet professional standards. While the business is wheelchair accessible and accepts credit cards, these positives are overshadowed by the overall poor reputation. I would not recommend this business to others."
