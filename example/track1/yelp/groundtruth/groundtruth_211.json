  "review": "I visited the SEPTA Girard Station for the first time and while the staff were friendly and helpful, which is a plus, the overall experience was marred by the surroundings. The station itself was clean and the trains ran on time, but the area around the station, especially outside the gates, was quite dirty and felt unsafe. There were \"weird people\" hanging around, and the presence of a strip club nearby didn't help the atmosphere. It's a shame because the station has potential, but the environment detracts significantly from the overall experience. I wouldn't recommend it to others unless the surrounding area improves."
