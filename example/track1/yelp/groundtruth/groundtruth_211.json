  "review": "I visited Pass & Stow before a Phillies game and had a pleasant experience. The margherita pizza was delicious, with fresh ingredients and a perfect crust. The atmosphere was nice, with both indoor and outdoor seating options. Service was friendly, though it was a bit crowded when we arrived. Overall, a good spot to grab a bite before the game."
