  "review": "Photographic Works offers a mix of high-quality services and a knowledgeable, friendly staff, which aligns well with my preference for excellent customer service and expertise. However, the business has some issues with inconsistency and reliability, which can be frustrating. Additionally, the prices are on the higher side, especially for basic services. While I appreciate the local and longstanding presence of the business, these drawbacks make it a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, it's a good option, but there's room for improvement in terms of consistency and pricing."
