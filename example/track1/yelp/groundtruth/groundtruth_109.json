  "review": "I had the pleasure of visiting Mrs Tiggy Winkle's, and it was an absolute delight! The store's unique and diverse selection of toys and games, including handcrafted and hand-painted items, is truly a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by mass-produced plastic. The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, making the shopping experience both enjoyable and informative. The atmosphere was magical, with a fun and welcoming environment that caters to both children and adults. It's sad to hear about the store's impending closure, but I'm grateful for the time I spent there and will cherish the high-quality, unique items I found. Highly recommend!"
