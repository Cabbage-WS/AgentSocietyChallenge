  "review": "I visited China City for the first time and had mixed feelings about the experience. The food was decent, but not exceptional, with some dishes lacking flavor and freshness. The service was friendly, but the overall quality didn't quite meet my expectations. I might give it another try, but I'm not rushing back."
