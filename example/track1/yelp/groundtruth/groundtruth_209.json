  "review": "Cavanaugh's Restaurant offers a lively atmosphere, perfect for watching sports and enjoying some bar food. The wings and calzones are a standout, and the prices are reasonable, which is a plus. However, the place can get very crowded, and the cleanliness is a bit of a concern, as some areas feel sticky and unclean. The service is generally friendly but can be inconsistent during peak hours, which is a downside. Overall, it's a decent spot for a casual night out, but it doesn't quite meet the high standards I have for service and cleanliness."
