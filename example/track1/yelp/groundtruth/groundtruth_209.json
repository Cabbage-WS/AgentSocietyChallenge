  "review": "I visited Party City for some Halloween decorations and was impressed by the variety of options available. The store was well-organized, and the staff were helpful in pointing me towards what I needed. However, some of the items felt a bit overpriced for the quality. Overall, it served its purpose, but I might look elsewhere for better deals next time."
