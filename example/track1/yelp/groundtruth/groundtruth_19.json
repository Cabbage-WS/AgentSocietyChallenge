  "review": "I visited Little Istanbul and found it to be a mixed experience. The Turkish cuisine, particularly the lamb and chicken gyros, was quite flavorful and satisfying, which aligns with my appreciation for high-quality and well-executed dishes. However, the service was somewhat inconsistent; while some staff were friendly, others seemed less attentive. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, but the portions were on the smaller side for the price, which I found a bit disappointing. Overall, it's a decent spot, but not quite the standout experience I was hoping for."
