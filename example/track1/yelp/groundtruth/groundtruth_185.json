The bagels were decent and the staff was friendly, but I couldn't help feeling that the quality and variety didn't match the high standards I'm used to in my favorite Japanese restaurants. The long wait times and higher prices were also a bit off-putting. Overall, it's a nice spot for a quick bite, but it's not something I'd return to frequently."
