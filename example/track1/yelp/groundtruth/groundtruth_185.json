  "review": "I had a mixed experience at Jerusalem Furniture. The staff was helpful in assisting me with my purchase, but the delivery process was quite disorganized. I appreciated their effort to resolve issues, but the lack of communication and coordination left me frustrated. Overall, it was an okay experience, but there's definitely room for improvement in their delivery service."
