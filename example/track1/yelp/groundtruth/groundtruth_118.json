  "review": "Passport Health Tucson Travel Clinic offers a comprehensive range of travel health services, and the staff are professional and knowledgeable, which is a significant plus. However, the prices are on the higher side, and there are some concerns about customer service, particularly with billing and appointment management. While the quality of the service is commendable, the cost and potential service issues make it a mixed experience."
