  "review": "I had a great experience renting an RV from Cruise America Motorhome Rental & Sales. The staff, especially Hank, were incredibly helpful and made the entire process smooth and stress-free. The RV was clean, well-maintained, and comfortable, which made our trip enjoyable. The prices were also reasonable, and the check-in and check-out processes were efficient. While I did hear about some maintenance issues from other customers, my experience was overwhelmingly positive. I would definitely consider renting from them again in the future."
