  "review": "Fish Hawk Spirits has a lot going for it, with high-quality spirits and a beautiful, inviting atmosphere. The free tastings and knowledgeable staff are definite pluses. However, the service can be hit or miss, and the prices are on the higher side. While I enjoyed my visit, the inconsistent service and cost make it a bit of a mixed bag. It's worth a try, but I'd recommend checking hours and going during less busy times."
