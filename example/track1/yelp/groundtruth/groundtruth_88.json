  "review": "I visited Liz Murtagh Boutique with high hopes, given the unique and high-quality merchandise mentioned in some reviews. However, my experience was quite disappointing. While the store has a nice selection of fashion items, the customer service was lacking. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, especially when I had questions about returns and exchanges. The rigid return policy and lack of communication from the store after attempting to follow up on a purchase were major turn-offs. It's a beautiful store, but the poor service and inflexibility make it hard to recommend."
