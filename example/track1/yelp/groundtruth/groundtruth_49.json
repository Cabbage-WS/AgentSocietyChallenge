  "review": "El Coqui Puerto Rican Restaurant is a delightful find, offering a cozy and clean atmosphere with a menu that truly stands out. The mofongo and pernil were especially delicious, and the friendly staff made the experience even better. While there were a few instances of slower service, the quality of the food and the overall ambiance more than made up for it. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy authentic Puerto Rican cuisine."
