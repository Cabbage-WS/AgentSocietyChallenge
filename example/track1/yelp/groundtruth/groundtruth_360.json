  "review": "I visited Cafe Nhu Quynh and found it to be a mixed experience. The food was delicious, especially the banh mi and Vietnamese iced coffee, which were both flavorful and well-prepared. The prices were reasonable, and the variety of menu options, including vegetarian choices, was a plus. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming, which added to the overall dining experience. However, the service was hit or miss; some staff members were friendly, while others were a bit rude. Additionally, the crusty bread used for the banh mi was a bit of a letdown. Despite these issues, I would still recommend this place for its high-quality food and affordable prices."
