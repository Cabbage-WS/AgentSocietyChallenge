  "review": "I visited Venuto's Old World Pizza with some reservations given the mixed reviews, and unfortunately, my experience did not live up to my expectations. While the place is kid-friendly and offers a variety of options, the pizza was disappointingly dry and lacked flavor, making it hard to justify the price. The dining area was comfortable, but cleanliness issues were noticeable, and the service was somewhat indifferent. For a place that prides itself on a homey feel, it fell short in delivering a warm and enjoyable dining experience."
