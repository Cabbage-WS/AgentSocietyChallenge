  "review": "My experience with Avis in Tampa was disappointing. The customer service was lackluster, and the staff seemed uninterested in helping me. I was charged extra for an additional driver and for a late return, despite only being a few minutes over the deadline. The car I received had an unpleasant odor, and there were no options for an upgrade. Overall, I found the experience to be quite frustrating and would not recommend Avis to others."
