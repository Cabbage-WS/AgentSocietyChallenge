  "review": "I visited Nelson J. Greer Painting Contractors for a home painting project and found the experience to be mixed. On the positive side, the team was professional and meticulous, paying attention to detail and protecting my property throughout the process. However, I did encounter some issues with communication, as the scheduling process was not as smooth as I had hoped. While the overall quality of the work was satisfactory, the one negative review I read about poor customer service and work quality gave me pause. I would recommend this business with the caveat that they need to improve their communication and customer service to fully meet their potential."
