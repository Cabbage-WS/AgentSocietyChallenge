  "review": "I visited Peter Piper Pizza for a family gathering, and while the place is definitely family-friendly and the staff were very accommodating, the overall experience was mixed. The food, particularly the pizza, was not up to par\u2014cold and tasting like it came straight from a freezer. The cleanliness was also an issue, with dirty floors and tables. However, the prices were reasonable, and the entertainment options like the carousel and games were enjoyable. It's a decent place for a family outing, but there's definitely room for improvement in terms of food quality and cleanliness."
