  "review": "I visited Karamelo King and had a mixed experience. The food was indeed fresh and flavorful, especially the tacos and Sonoran hot dogs, which lived up to the positive reviews. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming, and the prices were reasonable. However, the service was a bit hit or miss. While some staff members were friendly, others seemed inattentive, which was somewhat disappointing. Given the importance of a positive staff attitude to me, this aspect slightly dampened my overall experience. Still, I would recommend it for the food quality and value."
