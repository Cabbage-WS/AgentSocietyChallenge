  "review": "\"Mike's Smokehouse BBQ & Grill offers a unique, casual dining experience with some tasty BBQ options. The ribs and chicken were well-smoked and flavorful, and the side dishes, especially the fried okra, were a nice touch. The prices were reasonable, which is a plus. However, the service was a bit hit-or-miss; at times, it felt slow, and the staff could be more attentive. The atmosphere is rustic and charming, but it could use some cleaning, particularly the outdoor facilities. Overall, it's a decent place for a casual BBQ meal, but there's room for improvement in terms of service and consistency.\""
