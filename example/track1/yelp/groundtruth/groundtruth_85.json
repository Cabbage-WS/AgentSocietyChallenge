  "review": "Cartridge World Tucson offers a generally positive experience with their excellent customer service and knowledgeable staff. They are attentive and make an effort to work with their clients, which I appreciate. However, the inconsistent quality of refilled cartridges and limited inventory for certain printer models are concerns. While the staff is usually helpful, there are occasional negative interactions reported, which can be off-putting. Overall, it's a decent choice, but there's room for improvement in product consistency and inventory management."
