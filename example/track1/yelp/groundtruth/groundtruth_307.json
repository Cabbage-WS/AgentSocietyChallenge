However, the long wait times can be quite frustrating, and I've experienced a few issues with the food being bland or not prepared as ordered. The staff is generally friendly, but the inconsistency in food quality and service makes it a bit hit or miss. Still, it's worth a try if you're in the mood for some authentic Mexican cuisine and can deal with the wait."
