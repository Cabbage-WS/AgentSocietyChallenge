  "review": "I visited Cedars Restaurant and had a fantastic experience. The food was delicious and fresh, with a variety of dishes that catered to different tastes. The lamb and chicken shawarma were particularly standout, and the portions were generous. The service was friendly and attentive, making the dining experience very enjoyable. The casual and family-friendly atmosphere added to the overall positive vibe. While there were a few minor concerns about pricing, the value and quality of the food more than made up for it. Highly recommend for a great Middle Eastern dining experience!"
