  "review": "I visited Hong Kong House, and I must say, it's a solid choice for authentic Chinese and dim sum cuisine. The food quality was generally high, with fresh and flavorful dishes that hit the spot, especially the dim sum. The service was friendly and attentive, which is a plus, although there were a few moments where the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed. The atmosphere is clean and welcoming, and the prices are reasonable for the quality. However, I did notice some inconsistency in the food, which is a minor drawback. Overall, it's a great spot for a casual dining experience, and I would definitely come back for more."
