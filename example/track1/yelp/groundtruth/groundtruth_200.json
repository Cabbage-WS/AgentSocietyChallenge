  "review": "I visited Sweet Things Cupcake Shoppe with high expectations, but the experience was just average. The cupcakes were visually appealing, but the taste didn't quite live up to the hype. The frosting was overly sweet, and the cake was a bit dry. While the staff was friendly, the overall quality didn't justify the price."
