  "review": "I visited New Samosa with hopes of enjoying a good Indian meal, especially given the restaurant's reputation for vegetarian options. However, the experience fell short of my expectations. The food, while affordable, was disappointingly bland and lacked the vibrant flavors I was looking for. The samosas, which I was particularly excited about, were greasy and not as flavorful as I had hoped. The service was also subpar, with staff seeming disinterested and slow to attend to our needs. The ambiance of the restaurant was quite run-down, which detracted from the overall dining experience. I do appreciate the convenient location and the variety of vegetarian dishes, but these positives were not enough to outweigh the negatives."
