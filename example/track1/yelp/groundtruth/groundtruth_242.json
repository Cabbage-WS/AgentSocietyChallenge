  "review": "I had high hopes for Unitea, especially since I'm a tea enthusiast. The selection of loose-leaf teas was impressive, and the owner seemed knowledgeable. However, my experience was marred by inconsistent service and a somewhat awkward atmosphere. The tea I ordered was good, but the overall vibe didn't make me want to stay long. I hope they improve as they settle in, as the potential is there."
