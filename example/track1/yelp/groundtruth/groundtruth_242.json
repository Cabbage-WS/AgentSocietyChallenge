  "review": "Only You Wedding offers a mixed experience, with some aspects that align well with my preferences and others that fall short. The professional and attentive staff, particularly noted in many reviews, is a strong point, and the customization and flexibility of their services are appreciated. However, the few negative reviews mentioning unreliability and poor communication are concerning. While the overall quality of services like photography and makeup is praised, the potential risks of unmet promises and low-quality decorations make me hesitant to fully recommend this place. The value for money seems good, but the inconsistent service is a deal-breaker for me."
