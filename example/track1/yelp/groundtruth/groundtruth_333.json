  "review": "Cold Stone Creamery is a mixed bag. While the ice cream is creamy and delicious, with flavors like banana caramel crunch and German chocolate that hit the spot, the service can be hit or miss. I've experienced both friendly and helpful staff as well as slow and inattentive service. The shop can get quite cramped, especially during peak hours, and the cleanliness could use some improvement. Despite these issues, the convenient location near the AMC theater makes it a decent stop for a treat, but it doesn't quite meet my standards for a top-notch experience."
