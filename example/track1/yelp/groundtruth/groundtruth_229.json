The food was fresh and delicious, with standout dishes like the Eggroll Vermicelli and Vietnamese espresso. The staff was friendly and attentive, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. While it's not an Italian restaurant, the quality of the food and the excellent service are in line with what I value most in a dining establishment. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Vietnamese cuisine in Philadelphia."
