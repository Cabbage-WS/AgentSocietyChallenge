  "review": "I visited Manny's Steaks & Burgers and had a mixed experience. While the food was decent, particularly the burgers, the customer service was a significant letdown. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, which detracted from the overall dining experience. Additionally, the restaurant was quite loud, which I found uncomfortable. The lack of TV and the absence of outdoor seating also made it less appealing. Given the inconsistent quality and poor service, I wouldn't recommend this place to those looking for a relaxed and enjoyable meal."
