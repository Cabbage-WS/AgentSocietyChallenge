  "review": "Ochatto Hot Pot offers a unique and fresh dining experience, with a wide variety of high-quality ingredients and a modern, clean atmosphere. However, the service can be hit-or-miss, with some servers being unprofessional or inattentive, which detracts from the overall experience. The pricing is also a bit steep, especially considering the portion sizes and the inconsistent service. Despite these issues, the food quality and variety make it a decent choice for a hot pot meal, but there's definitely room for improvement."
