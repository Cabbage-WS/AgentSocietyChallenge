  "review": "Cimarron Animal Hospital offers a range of pet services and has a generally positive reputation for its friendly and caring staff, as well as its clean and welcoming environment. However, the inconsistent customer service and communication issues mentioned in some reviews are concerning. While the clinic provides comprehensive care and has convenient hours, the potential for high costs and unnecessary testing may not align with my preference for affordable and straightforward services. Overall, it's a good option, but there's room for improvement in terms of consistency and transparency."
