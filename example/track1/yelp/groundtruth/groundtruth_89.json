  "review": "I visited China Garden and found it to be a mixed bag. The staff was generally friendly and attentive, which is always a plus, and the restaurant was clean and welcoming. The food had a good variety, especially the sushi and fresh stir-fry options, and the prices were reasonable. However, I did notice some inconsistencies in food quality, with a few dishes being a bit greasy. Additionally, the lack of outdoor seating and the average noise level detracted from the overall experience. Despite these issues, it's still a decent choice for a casual dining experience, but there's room for improvement."
