  "review": "I had high hopes for Nails Magic, but my experience was disappointing and far from what I expected. The quality of the nail work was subpar, with uneven application and a lack of attention to detail. The staff was unprofessional and dismissive, which made the experience even more frustrating. Additionally, the wait time was unnecessarily long, and the prices were not justified given the poor service. Based on my preferences for quality and customer service, Nails Magic falls short and does not meet my standards."
