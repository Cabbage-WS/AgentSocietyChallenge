  "review": "** I visited Pennsport Market & Deli with high hopes based on the fresh and high-quality food mentioned in some reviews. While the food was indeed delicious and perfect for events, the customer service was a major letdown. The staff seemed disinterested and the atmosphere was not welcoming at all. The lack of basic amenities and parking options also detracted from the overall experience. It's a shame because the food alone makes it worth considering, but the poor service and environment make it hard to recommend."
