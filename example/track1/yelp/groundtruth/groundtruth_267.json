  "review": "I visited Chipotle Mexican Grill on Gandy Blvd in Tampa, and it was a mixed experience. The casual and fast-food environment was convenient, and the options were varied. However, the service was a bit hit or miss. The staff seemed overwhelmed during peak hours, leading to longer wait times, which I found frustrating. The hygiene standards were generally acceptable, but I noticed a few areas that could use improvement. Overall, it's a decent place for a quick meal, but it falls short of my expectations for service and efficiency."
