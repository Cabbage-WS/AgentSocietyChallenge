  "review": "I recently visited Midtown Liquor & Deli and was thoroughly impressed. The staff was incredibly friendly and made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in. The selection of wines, beers, and spirits is amazing, and they even have a small deli which was a nice surprise. The prices are reasonable, and the store is conveniently located, making it a great local resource. Despite a minor issue with inconsistent hours, the overall experience was excellent, and I definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area."
