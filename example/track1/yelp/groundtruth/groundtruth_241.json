  "review": "I visited China Pearl Super Buffet with high hopes, but the experience was a major letdown. The food was cold, bland, and unappetizing, with many dishes seeming to have been sitting out for far too long. The sushi was old, and the rice was stale. The restaurant itself was dirty and neglected, which was a stark contrast to the clean and welcoming environments I usually enjoy. The few positive aspects, like friendly staff and reasonable prices, were not enough to salvage the overall experience. I will not be returning to this buffet."
