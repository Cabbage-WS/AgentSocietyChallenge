  "review": "I visited Mimosa Nails and had a mixed experience. While the staff was friendly and the salon was clean, I was disappointed with the service quality. The technician seemed rushed and there were additional charges for what I thought were basic services. More concerning, some hygiene practices were lacking, which is a major red flag for me. I value safety and professionalism, and this salon fell short in those areas. I won't be returning."
