  "review": "I visited Bootleggers Brewing with some friends and while the place has a lot of potential, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The staff was friendly and the beer selection was impressive, but the service was disappointingly slow, which is a major pet peeve of mine. We also had to deal with the noise from an open mic night, which made it difficult to enjoy our conversation. While the atmosphere and location are nice, the service issues and event noise made it a less enjoyable experience overall."
