  "review": "I had mixed feelings about my experience with Mad Batter Bakery. While the cupcakes and desserts were indeed delicious and beautifully presented, the service was unreliable, which is a big deal for me. The owner, Chelle, was responsive at first but then became uncommunicative, especially when issues arose. This inconsistency and lack of professionalism, particularly for important events, is a significant drawback. I appreciate the free delivery and the reasonable prices, but the reliability issues and unprofessional behavior make it hard to recommend this bakery without reservation."
