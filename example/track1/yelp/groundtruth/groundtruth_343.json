  "review": "I visited Two Brothers Pizza with mixed feelings. While the place is known for its friendly service and quick delivery, my experience was quite the opposite. The food quality was inconsistent; the pizza was decent, but the chicken stromboli was sub-par and tasted like it wasn't fresh. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, especially when I pointed out the issues with my order. Despite the positive reviews, I found the overall experience underwhelming and wouldn't recommend it to others looking for a reliable and high-quality dining option."
