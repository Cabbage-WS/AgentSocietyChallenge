  "review": "I visited the U-Haul Neighborhood Dealer on West Cypress Street, and it was a disappointing experience. The staff was unprofessional and rude, and the service was far from what I expected. There were additional charges for cleaning, even though the vehicle wasn't clean to begin with. The overall atmosphere was chaotic, and I felt unsafe when they directed me to hook up the trailer in a questionable area. This location needs significant improvements in both service and cleanliness."
