  "review": "Thinh An Kitchen & Tofu is a hidden gem in Tampa. The food is consistently delicious, with standout dishes like the pho and banh mi. The atmosphere is clean and welcoming, with a casual and classy vibe that makes it perfect for a relaxed meal. The staff is friendly and attentive, which is always a plus. While the tables are a bit close together, the quality of the food and service more than make up for it. The prices are reasonable, and the variety of menu options, including vegetarian and vegan choices, is impressive. A great spot for a satisfying meal."
