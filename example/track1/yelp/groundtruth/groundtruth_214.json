  "review": "I visited Nico's Taco Shop for a quick breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. The breakfast burrito was delicious, with fresh and crispy bacon and a nice kick from the green salsa. The service was friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere was clean and cozy, reminiscent of a Southern barbershop. While the prices are slightly higher than expected and the portion sizes could be a bit larger, the overall experience was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this place for a satisfying meal."
