  "review": "I had a decent experience at the Adidas outlet store. The staff was friendly and helpful, and I found some great deals on athletic wear. The store was well-organized, and the pricing was clear. However, I wish there was more seating available for trying on shoes, as it got a bit crowded. Overall, a good shopping experience with some room for improvement."
