  "review": "My experience at Ruth's Chris Steak House was mixed. The steaks were indeed tender and flavorful, living up to the restaurant's reputation for high-quality food. The ambiance was elegant and perfect for a special occasion. However, the service was a bit slow, and the prices were quite steep, which made the overall experience less enjoyable. While the food and atmosphere were great, the value for money and service speed are areas that need improvement."
