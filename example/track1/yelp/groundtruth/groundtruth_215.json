  "review": "I visited Mary Jo's Performing Arts Academy with high hopes, given the creative and engaging nature of the classes offered. While the teachers were indeed talented and knowledgeable, making the classes enjoyable, the overall experience was marred by poor customer service and facility issues. The waiting area was overcrowded, and communication regarding class changes and cancellations was lacking. These aspects significantly detracted from the positive aspects of the studio, leading to a less than satisfactory experience."
