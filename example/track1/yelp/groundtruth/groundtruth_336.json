  "review": "Asian Fusion & Steak offers a diverse menu with decent quality food, particularly their sushi and Chinese dishes. While the prices are fair and delivery is generally quick, there are some inconsistencies in food quality and service that are noticeable. The friendly staff and variety of options are positives, but the occasional long delivery times and communication issues with order accuracy detract from the overall experience. Given my preference for high-quality, consistent dining experiences, I find this place to be a mixed bag, but still worth a try for its strengths."
