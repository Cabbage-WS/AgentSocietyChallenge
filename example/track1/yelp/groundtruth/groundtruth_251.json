  "review": "Chhaya Cafe offers a cozy and comfortable atmosphere, which is a plus for a casual dining experience. The early opening hours are convenient, and the menu has a good variety of options, including excellent waffles and pancakes. However, the prices are a bit steep, especially for the portion sizes, and the service can be slow during peak times. While the staff is generally friendly, the small space can feel cramped, which detracts from the overall experience. Given these mixed factors, Chhaya Cafe is a decent spot, but it doesn't fully meet my expectations for value and efficiency."
