  "review": "I visited this McDonald's on Gunn Hwy, and it was a disappointing experience. The service was incredibly slow, and the staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful. The food was cold and stale, particularly the fries, which is unacceptable. The cleanliness of the restaurant was also concerning, with instances of staff not following proper hygiene practices. Overall, this location does not meet the standards I expect from a fast-food chain, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
