  "review": "Champion Pool and Spa Supply offers a mix of positive and negative experiences. The knowledgeable and helpful staff, competitive pricing, and friendly atmosphere are definite highlights that align with my values. However, I am concerned about the reports of poor service quality and product issues, such as premature peeling of pool paint. While these negative aspects are not the norm, they are significant enough to give me pause. Overall, I would recommend this business but with the caveat to be cautious and thoroughly research before committing to any major services."
