  "review": "I visited USA International Health and Beauty for a haircut and was disappointed. While the prices are reasonable, the quality of the service did not meet my expectations. The stylist seemed inexperienced and rushed through the haircut, which resulted in an uneven and unprofessional look. The salon's location is convenient, but the lack of parking options is a significant inconvenience. I was hoping for a more personalized and high-quality experience, especially given the positive reviews for some of the staff. I will likely try another salon in the area for better service."
