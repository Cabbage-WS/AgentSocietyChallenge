  "review": "Visited New England Pizza recently and had a mixed experience. The food was quite good, especially the Jamaican and Canadian pizzas, which were delicious and well-prepared. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, which is a plus. However, the wait time was a bit long, and the service was inconsistent. Some staff members were friendly and efficient, while others seemed less attentive. Overall, it's a decent place to grab a bite, but there's room for improvement in terms of service and wait times."
