  "review": "Bay Breeze Cafe is a convenient spot located inside a work building, offering quick bites and decent food options. The staff is friendly, and the Cuban sandwiches are particularly good. However, the overall quality of the food is just average, making it a passable choice for a quick meal but not a standout dining experience."
