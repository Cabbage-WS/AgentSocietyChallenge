  "review": "D'jakarta Cafe offers a unique dining experience with delicious and authentic Indonesian cuisine, which is a plus for someone who appreciates high-quality food. The staff is friendly and attentive, making the visit comfortable. However, the long wait times for food and the occasional inconsistency in food quality, especially with delivery orders, are significant drawbacks. While the prices are reasonable, the limited menu and parking difficulties also detract from the overall experience. It's a good spot, but there's room for improvement."
