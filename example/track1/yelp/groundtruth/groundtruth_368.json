  "review": "Santoro's Pizzeria is a mixed bag. While the pizza is consistently delicious and the staff is friendly, the long wait times and occasional inconsistencies in food quality are significant drawbacks. The casual and authentic Italian atmosphere adds to the charm, but the pricing feels a bit steep for the service and wait. Overall, it's a good spot, but there's room for improvement in terms of efficiency and consistency."
