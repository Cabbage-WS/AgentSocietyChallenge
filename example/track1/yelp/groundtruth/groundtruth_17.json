  "review": "Kwality Fusion offers a unique fusion of Pakistani and Indian cuisines, which I found to be quite interesting. The food was generally well-prepared and flavorful, and the takeout and delivery options were convenient. However, the service could use some improvement. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed during peak hours, and the wait times were longer than expected. While I appreciate the effort put into the food, the overall experience didn't quite meet my high standards for exceptional service. I would recommend this place for those looking to try something different, but it might not be the best choice if you're in a hurry or expecting top-notch service."
