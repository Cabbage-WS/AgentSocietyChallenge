  "review": "I visited ATL wings and found it to be a mixed bag. The wings were indeed delicious and crispy, with a great variety of flavors that catered to different tastes. The atmosphere was casual and welcoming, which is a plus. However, the service was a bit hit-or-miss; the staff was friendly but sometimes slow, and there were a few issues with order accuracy. The cleanliness of the restaurant could also use some improvement, as some tables were not as clean as they should be. Given the quality of the food, it\u2019s worth a visit, but there\u2019s definitely room for improvement in terms of service and cleanliness."
