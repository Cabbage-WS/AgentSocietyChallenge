  "review": "I visited Wawa at 1300 Chestnut St in Philadelphia and had a mixed experience. The store is clean and modern, and the variety of food and drink options is impressive. The food quality, especially the sandwiches and coffee, is good. However, the service was a significant letdown. The staff was often inattentive, and the wait times were excessively long, especially during peak hours. The store also appeared disorganized, with out-of-stock items and messy counters. While the affordable prices and free WiFi are nice, the poor service and long wait times make it difficult to recommend this location."
