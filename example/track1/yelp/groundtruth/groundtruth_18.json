  "review": "I visited the T-Mobile store to explore switching my service, but the experience was mixed. The staff seemed knowledgeable, but the process felt a bit rushed, and I wasn't fully informed about all my options. While the store was clean and organized, the lack of detailed explanations left me feeling unsure about my decision. Overall, it was an okay visit, but I wish the customer service had been more thorough."
