  "review": "Mission Pet Clinic is a standout in the veterinary community. The consistent business hours and clear communication about their services are a breath of fresh air. Dr. Callahan and her staff are incredibly caring, knowledgeable, and thorough, which is exactly what you want when it comes to your pets. The clinic is also affordable and transparent about costs, making it a trustworthy choice. While there was one mention of long wait times, the overall experience and quality of care far outweigh this minor inconvenience. I highly recommend Mission Pet Clinic for anyone looking for a reliable and compassionate veterinary service."
