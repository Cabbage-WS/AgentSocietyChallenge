  "review": "\"Chickpeas Falafel & Grill is a delightful find in Philadelphia. The food is absolutely delicious, with fresh and authentic falafel and hummus that stand out. The portions are generous, and the prices are very reasonable, making it a great value for money. The staff is friendly and attentive, which is a huge plus. While the restaurant can sometimes run out of certain items and the service can be a bit slow, these minor issues are far outweighed by the quality of the food and the welcoming atmosphere. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great Mediterranean dining experience.\""
