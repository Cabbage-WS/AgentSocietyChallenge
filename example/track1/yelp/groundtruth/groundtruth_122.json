The food was outstanding, especially the arepas and empanadas, which were flavorful and authentic. The casual and inviting atmosphere made the experience even more enjoyable. While the service was a bit slow during peak hours, it was worth the wait for the quality of the food and the overall experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Venezuelan dining experience."
