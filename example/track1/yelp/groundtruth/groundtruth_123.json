  "review": "I visited the Target on East Old Spanish Trail in Tucson and had a mixed experience. The store is clean and well-stocked, which is a plus, and the staff was generally friendly. However, the long lines and limited register availability were frustrating, especially during peak hours. The variety of products is good, but I noticed some items were out of stock, particularly in the electronics section. The presence of a Starbucks inside is a nice touch, but overall, the shopping experience didn't quite meet my expectations for quick and efficient service."
