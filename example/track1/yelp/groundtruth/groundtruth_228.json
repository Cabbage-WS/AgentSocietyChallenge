The deli has a welcoming atmosphere and serves delicious, large portions of food, which I appreciate. The friendly and attentive service is a plus, and the outdoor seating and kids-friendly environment make it a good spot for families. However, the inconsistent food quality and higher prices are drawbacks. While the deli has its charm, these issues prevent me from giving it a higher rating."
