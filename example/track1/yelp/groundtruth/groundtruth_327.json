  "review": "Planet Sub offers a solid dining experience with high-quality sandwiches and a clean, efficient environment. The staff is quick and friendly, which is a plus for a fast-food setting. While it doesn't have the same level of ambiance or professional service as some of my favorite high-end restaurants, the food is consistently good, and the outdoor seating and free WiFi add to the overall appeal. It's a great spot for a quick, satisfying meal."
