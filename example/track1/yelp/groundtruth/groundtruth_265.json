  "review": "Manny's On the Bay Plants is a great find for anyone looking for high-quality plants at competitive prices. The staff, particularly Manny, are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, providing excellent customer service. The selection is impressive, and the plants are healthier and more varied than those found in big box stores. While there are a few reports of plants not surviving, the overall experience is positive and worth the visit. I highly recommend this nursery for anyone looking to enhance their garden."
