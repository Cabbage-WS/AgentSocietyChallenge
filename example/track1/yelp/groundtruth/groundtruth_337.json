  "review": "The Admirals Club at Philadelphia Airport is a decent spot to relax between flights. The space is clean and the staff is friendly, but it feels a bit cramped and lacks the amenities of larger lounges. While it serves its purpose, it doesn't quite meet the expectations of a premium lounge experience."
