  "review": "The Buzz has a few appealing aspects, such as its spacious and comfortable seating, free Wi-Fi, and a good location near the waterfront. However, my experience was marred by indifferent and unfriendly staff, which is a significant issue for me. The cleanliness, especially in the restrooms, also left much to be desired. While the prices are on par with the area, the quality of the food and coffee was inconsistent, with some items, like the bagel, being stale and the coffee tasting burnt. Overall, the negatives outweigh the positives, making it a place I would not return to."
