  "review": "I visited DK Sushi on a whim, hoping for a pleasant dining experience. Unfortunately, my visit fell short of expectations. The service was lackluster; the staff seemed disinterested and took a long time to acknowledge us. The sushi selection was limited, and the few options available were not as fresh as I had hoped. The casual atmosphere was nice, but the overall experience was marred by the poor service and mediocre food quality. I would not recommend this place to others looking for a great sushi experience."
