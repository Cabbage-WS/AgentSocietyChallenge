  "review": "I visited the Singapore Chinese Vegetarian Restaurant and found it to be a mixed experience. The food was delicious, especially the dim sum and General Tso's chicken, and the prices were very reasonable, which I appreciated. The staff was friendly and accommodating, which made the visit enjoyable. However, the food was a bit greasier than I prefer, and the decor was somewhat dated, which detracted from the overall experience. Despite these minor issues, I would still recommend this place for its tasty vegetarian options and good service."
