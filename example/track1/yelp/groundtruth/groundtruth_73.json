The prices are reasonable, making it a great value for the quality. However, the limited seating and occasional service issues, such as long wait times, could be a bit frustrating. Additionally, parking can be a challenge, especially during peak hours. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall experience is still quite good, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious Vietnamese sandwich."
