  "review": "Axis Pizza is a convenient spot, especially for late-night cravings, but the quality can be hit or miss. The pizza is decent, though it sometimes lacks flavor and can be overly doughy. The 24/7 availability is a major plus, but I wish the consistency was better. Overall, it's a decent option for a quick bite, but not a standout in terms of taste."
