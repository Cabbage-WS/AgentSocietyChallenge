The staff was incredibly friendly and professional, making me feel welcome from the moment I walked in. The salon is clean and well-decorated, creating a relaxing and inviting atmosphere. The spray tan was perfect, with no splotchy or uneven results. While parking can be a bit tight, it's a minor inconvenience considering the exceptional service and quality. I will definitely be back for future tanning and waxing services!"
