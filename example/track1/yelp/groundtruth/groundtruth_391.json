  "review": "I visited Sushi Tsu Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi Bar and found it to be a mixed experience. The sushi, particularly the Volcano and California rolls, was excellent and reasonably priced. The staff was generally friendly and attentive, which is a plus. However, I experienced a long wait time for a hibachi table, even though the restaurant appeared to be underutilized, which was frustrating. The overall atmosphere is good for social gatherings, but the service issues and variable food quality in the hibachi section slightly dampened my experience. I would consider returning for the sushi, but I'd avoid the hibachi unless I have more time to spare."
