  "review": "I visited this McDonald's for breakfast, hoping for a quick and satisfying meal. Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing. The service was slow and unresponsive, with long wait times both in the drive-thru and inside. The food, while fresh, was not as high-quality as I expected, and the prices were a bit higher than other locations. The place was clean, but the overall experience was marred by the poor customer service and inefficiency. I won't be returning anytime soon."
