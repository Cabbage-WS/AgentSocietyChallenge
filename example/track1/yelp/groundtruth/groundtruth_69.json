  "review": "Sonic Drive-In has a mixed bag of experiences, which is somewhat reflected in the overall reviews. I appreciate the friendly service, especially from staff members like Steven and Gabriel, who go the extra mile to ensure a good experience. The menu is diverse and offers some delicious options, particularly the burgers and shakes. However, the inconsistency in food quality and order accuracy can be frustrating. I've experienced long wait times during peak hours, which can dampen the overall experience. Additionally, the cleanliness of the place could be better, as some areas seem neglected. While I can still enjoy a visit here, the inconsistencies and service issues prevent me from giving it a higher rating."
