  "review": "I had high expectations for Farmacy Vegan Kitchen & Bakery, and while the food was good, it didn't completely blow me away. The avocado BLT wrap was flavorful but a bit too salty for my taste. The desserts, however, were fantastic\u2014especially the cinnamon roll. The staff was friendly, but the overall experience felt a bit overpriced for what it offered."
