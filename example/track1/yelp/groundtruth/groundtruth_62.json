  "review": "I had high expectations for Jerk Hut - Seminole Heights based on the positive buzz, and it mostly delivered. The Jamaican beef patties and chicken roti were absolutely delicious, and the portions were generous, making it a great value for the price. The staff was friendly and efficient, and the place was clean and well-organized. However, I did experience a bit of a wait for my order, which was a minor inconvenience. Overall, it\u2019s a solid choice for Caribbean cuisine in Tampa, and I\u2019d definitely come back for the food."
