  "review": "This Wawa location was a huge disappointment. The service was painfully slow, and the staff seemed uninterested in their jobs. The overall cleanliness was also lacking, with a noticeable amount of trash and debris around the gas pumps and store entrance. I won't be returning to this location anytime soon."
