  "review": "I visited \"Not Your Average Joe's Pizza\" hoping for a great pizza experience, but I found the overall visit to be somewhat disappointing. The pizza had a thin, crispy crust and some good toppings, but it lacked the fresh, high-quality ingredients I typically look for. The service was friendly, but the location next to a strip club and the former Taco Bell building felt off-putting. The prices were reasonable, but the food quality didn't justify it, especially given the inconsistencies mentioned by other reviewers. I was hoping for more, particularly in a place that prides itself on being \"not your average\" pizza spot."
