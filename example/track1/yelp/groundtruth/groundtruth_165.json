  "review": "I had a solid experience at Pappoule's. The gyro was flavorful and the portions were generous, though the pita could have been a bit larger to wrap everything properly. The staff was friendly and the service was quick, making it a convenient option for a quick meal. Overall, it's a decent spot for Greek food in the area."
