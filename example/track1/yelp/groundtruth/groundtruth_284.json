  "review": "El Soto Deli & Grocery is a breath of fresh air in Philadelphia. The deli offers a wide variety of delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced sandwiches, with the torta and caprese panini standing out. The family-run business is incredibly welcoming and friendly, which makes the experience even better. The store is clean and well-organized, and the staff is always ready to help and customize your order. Although the hot sandwiches can take a bit longer to prepare, the quality and taste are well worth the wait. A definite must-visit!"
