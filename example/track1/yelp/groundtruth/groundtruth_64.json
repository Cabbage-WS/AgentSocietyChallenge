  "review": "\"House of Pita Hanan offers some of the most authentic and delicious Middle Eastern food I've had in Philadelphia. The kefta and falafel are particularly outstanding, and the prices are reasonable for the quality. However, the portion sizes are on the smaller side, which can be a bit disappointing, especially for the price. Additionally, the service can be hit or miss; sometimes it's quick and friendly, but other times it's slow and inattentive. Overall, it's a good spot for a quick, tasty meal, but the inconsistencies in service and portion sizes make it a bit of a mixed experience.\""
