  "review": "MaFooCo is a delightful food truck that offers a unique blend of Korean and Mexican cuisines. The food was excellent, with a variety of dishes that catered to different tastes. I particularly enjoyed the outdoor seating, which provided a casual and relaxed atmosphere. The service was quick and friendly, and the price was very reasonable. While it doesn't have a romantic or upscale ambiance, it's a great spot for a casual dinner or a fun night out with friends. Highly recommended!"
