  "review": "The Silo Eatery Coffee Bakery is a delightful spot with a fresh and varied menu. The Margherita flatbread and Haystack sandwich were both excellent, with well-seasoned ingredients and a satisfying taste. The cafe's outdoor seating area is perfect for people watching, and the staff is friendly and efficient. While the Cuban sandwich could use some improvements in bread quality, the overall experience was very positive. The free WiFi and clean, welcoming atmosphere make it a great place to relax or work."
