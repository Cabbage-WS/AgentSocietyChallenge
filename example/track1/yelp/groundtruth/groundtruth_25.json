  "review": "\"Julio's Mufflers provides a solid mix of friendly and knowledgeable service, which is a breath of fresh air in the automotive repair industry. The staff, especially Julio, are honest and transparent, ensuring you only pay for the repairs you actually need. While the service is fast and efficient, the cash-only policy and limited scope of repairs are minor inconveniences. Overall, a reliable and trustworthy option for your muffler needs.\""
