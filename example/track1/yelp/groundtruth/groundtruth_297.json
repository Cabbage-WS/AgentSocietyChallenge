  "review": "I visited Sticky's Smoke Shop with high hopes for a pleasant shopping experience, but it fell short in several areas. While the store has a good selection of products and reasonable prices, the customer service was inconsistent. Some staff members were friendly and helpful, but others were rude and unprofessional. Additionally, I encountered issues with a defective product and the lack of a clear return policy, which was disappointing. The store's atmosphere was decent, but the overall experience was marred by these shortcomings."
