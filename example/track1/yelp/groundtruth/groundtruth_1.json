  "review": "I had a terrible experience with Brighthouse Networks. The service is unreliable, with frequent outages and slow internet speeds. The customer service is a nightmare, with unhelpful representatives and long wait times. I also faced unexpected increases in my bill, and the company failed to honor promotions. It's frustrating to deal with a service provider that doesn't seem to care about their customers. I would strongly advise against using Brighthouse Networks."
