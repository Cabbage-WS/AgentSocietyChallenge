  "review": "I recently visited IDentical All About Your Smile, and I was thoroughly impressed. The office is clean and modern, and the staff is incredibly professional and friendly. Dr. Yanez and the hygienists were gentle and took the time to explain everything in detail, which I appreciated. The procedures were painless, and the office was efficient with minimal waiting. While there were a couple of minor scheduling issues, the overall experience was excellent, and I feel confident in the quality of care I received."
