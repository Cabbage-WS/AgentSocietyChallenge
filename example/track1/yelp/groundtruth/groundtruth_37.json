  "review": "I visited Chipotle Mexican Grill for a quick lunch and had a mixed experience. The food was fresh and well-prepared, which I appreciated, especially the burrito bowl with sofritas. The staff was generally friendly and efficient, but the service could be more attentive. The casual, clean environment was welcoming, but it lacked the festive atmosphere and drink options I typically enjoy. Overall, it was a decent meal, but it didn't quite meet my higher standards for dining out."
