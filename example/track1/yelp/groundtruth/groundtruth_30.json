  "review": "Club Vapor offers a unique vaping experience and is affordable, which are positive aspects. However, as someone who values outdoor activities, family-friendly environments, and unique, engaging experiences, this vape shop did not meet my expectations. The atmosphere and services are more suited for a specific audience and do not cater to my preferences for recreational and family-oriented activities. While the staff seemed friendly, the overall environment was not what I was looking for."
