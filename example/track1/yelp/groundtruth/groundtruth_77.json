  "review": "Valley Green Inn offers a beautiful, historic setting that is truly picturesque, making it a perfect spot for a special occasion or a relaxing weekend brunch. The outdoor seating with views of the Wissahickon creek adds to the charm. However, the food quality is hit or miss; while some dishes were delicious, others were overpriced and poorly prepared. The service was generally attentive, but there were instances of slow service and unfriendly staff. Despite these issues, the overall experience was enjoyable, but there is room for improvement."
