  "review": "I had high hopes for ACME Markets, but my experience was quite disappointing. The store is clean and well-stocked, which is a plus, but the customer service was a significant letdown. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, and there were long wait times at the registers. The prices were reasonable, but the quality of some items, particularly the produce, was subpar. Overall, it feels like a place that could do much better in terms of service and product quality."
