  "review": "I visited this Starbucks location on a busy afternoon and found the experience to be quite mixed. The coffee and food were of good quality, and the atmosphere was pleasant, making it a nice spot for a quick break. However, the service was slow and the staff seemed overwhelmed, leading to long wait times even when there wasn't a significant line. Additionally, the inability to use my Starbucks Rewards points was a disappointment. While the location is convenient, the inconsistencies in service and the crowded, noisy environment make it less appealing for a relaxing visit."
