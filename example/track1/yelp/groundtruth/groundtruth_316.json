  "review": "Bagel Bagel is a delightful find in Philadelphia, offering some of the freshest and most delicious bagels I've had. The quality of the ingredients is evident, and the staff is friendly and efficient. The touch screen ordering system is a modern touch that adds to the overall convenience. While there were a few mentions of inconsistent orders and occasional staff hygiene concerns, these issues were rare and did not detract from my overall positive experience. The value for money is excellent, and the bagels are perfect for a quick and satisfying meal. Highly recommended!"
