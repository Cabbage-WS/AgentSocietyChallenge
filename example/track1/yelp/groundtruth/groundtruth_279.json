  "review": "I had high hopes for The Pink Plumber, given their positive attributes like quick response times and professional technicians. However, the overall experience was disappointing. The services were significantly overpriced, and the technician tried to upsell unnecessary products. The quality of work was also subpar, requiring multiple visits to fix the same issue. While they were initially responsive, the lack of transparency and poor value for money made this a frustrating experience. I would recommend finding a more affordable and reliable option."
