  "review": "I tried Sam's Pizza, hoping it would be a great addition to my local dining options, especially since I enjoy Chinese dumplings and was looking for a similar level of quality. Unfortunately, Sam's Pizza fell far short of my expectations. The food quality was poor, with some dishes tasting spoiled, and the hygiene standards were questionable. The customer service was unprofessional and unresponsive to my concerns, and the delivery staff, while friendly, couldn't make up for the overall negative experience. I won't be returning, and I would advise others to look elsewhere for a better pizza experience."
