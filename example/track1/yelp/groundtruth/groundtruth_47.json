  "review": "\"Dan's Fresh Meats is a hidden gem in Philadelphia, and it's exactly the kind of place I love. The quality of the meats is top-notch, and the Italian hoagies are some of the best I've ever had. The staff, including Dan, are incredibly friendly and go out of their way to make sure every customer is satisfied. The prices are reasonable, and the old-school, neighborhood feel adds to the charm. Despite the occasional crowds, the personalized service and fresh ingredients make it well worth the visit. Highly recommended!\""
