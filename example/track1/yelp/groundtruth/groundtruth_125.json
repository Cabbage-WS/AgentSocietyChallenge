  "stars": 1.0,
  "review": "My experience with Green Leaf At Broadway was disappointing. The property is marred by poor maintenance, unprofessional staff, and safety concerns, which are deal-breakers for me. While a few positive reviews mention friendly and responsive staff, the overwhelming majority of feedback highlights unsanitary conditions, ongoing construction, and a lack of security. Given my past negative experience with property management, I would advise against renting here. The issues reported by other residents align with my own expectations of what to avoid in a living space."
