  "review": "I visited Rittenhouse Needlepoint with high hopes, given the positive reviews, but my experience was quite mixed. The store has a charming and cozy atmosphere, which I appreciated, and the selection of materials is impressive. However, the customer service left much to be desired. The staff seemed uninterested and unhelpful, which was disappointing, especially since I was a beginner looking for guidance. Additionally, the prices were quite steep, and the limited operating hours made it difficult to visit. Overall, while there are some redeeming qualities, the poor service and high costs detracted from my experience."
