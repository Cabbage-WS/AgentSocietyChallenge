  "review": "I visited JCPenney at 5265 S Calle Santa Cruz, and overall, it was a pleasant shopping experience. The Sephora and salon sections stood out for their excellent customer service and knowledgeable staff. The store offers a wide range of products, and there were some great deals on women's and children's clothing. However, the general staff could be more attentive, and the check-out process was a bit slow. Despite these minor issues, I would definitely recommend this location for its quality services and good selection."
