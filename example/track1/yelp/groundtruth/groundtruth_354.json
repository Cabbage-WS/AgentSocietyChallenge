  "review": "Charley's American Bar & Restaurant offers a lively atmosphere with great food and drinks. The karaoke nights are a blast, and the staff is friendly and attentive. While the experience was mostly enjoyable, the limited parking and occasional service hiccups slightly dampened the fun. Overall, it's a solid spot for a night out with friends."
