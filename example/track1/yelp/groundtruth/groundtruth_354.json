  "review": "I visited Soul D'lysh & Catering with some expectations based on the positive reviews, but unfortunately, the experience was quite mixed. The food was hit-or-miss; while some dishes were fresh and flavorful, others were bland and overcooked. The lack of credit card acceptance and the absence of table service were minor inconveniences. The staff was generally friendly, but the service could be more attentive and efficient. Given the inconsistencies, I can't give it a higher rating, but I do think they have the potential to improve."
