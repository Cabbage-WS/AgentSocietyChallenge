  "review": "Zoes Kitchen is a great spot for a family lunch. The menu offers a variety of fresh and healthy options, which is perfect for those looking for something nutritious. The staff is friendly and efficient, making the dining experience smooth and enjoyable. The atmosphere is clean and welcoming, with a casual yet classy feel. While the portion sizes could be a bit larger, and the parking can be a challenge, the quality of the food and the service more than make up for these minor issues. I particularly enjoyed the chicken and steak kabobs, which were both delicious and well-prepared. A solid choice for a satisfying meal."
