  "review": "I had high hopes for Gee's Garden after hearing mixed reviews, but my experience was just average. The dim sum options were decent, but some dishes were lukewarm, which was disappointing. The service was friendly, but the overall vibe felt a bit outdated. I might give it another try, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations."
