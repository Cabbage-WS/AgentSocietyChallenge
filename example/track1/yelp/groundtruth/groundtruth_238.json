  "review": "Epic Cafe offers a unique and welcoming atmosphere with a variety of vegan and gluten-free options, which is a significant plus for someone with dietary restrictions. The food, especially the baked goods and breakfast items, is consistently praised for its quality. However, the long wait times and occasional unfriendly service can be frustrating. Additionally, the prices are a bit steep, which may not justify the overall experience. Despite these drawbacks, the cafe still manages to provide a pleasant and accommodating environment, making it a middle-of-the-road choice."
