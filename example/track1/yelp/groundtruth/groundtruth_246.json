  "review": "I had a mixed experience with Elite Roofing Services. On the positive side, the team was professional and communicated clearly throughout the process, which aligns with what I value in a service provider. However, I was concerned about the one highly critical review that detailed significant property damage and financial mismanagement. While the majority of reviews are positive, the potential for such issues makes me hesitant to give a higher rating. I would recommend them with some reservations, especially regarding their attention to detail and property care."
