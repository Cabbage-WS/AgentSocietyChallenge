  "review": "I visited the Cuban Sandwich Festival and had a mixed experience. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was lively with great music, which made it a fun outing. However, the long lines at the food vendors were frustrating, and by the time we arrived, some of the best dishes had already run out. Despite these issues, it was a good family-friendly event, and I enjoyed the variety of food and activities."
