  "review": "I visited Soho Tavern, and while the friendly staff and good music were noticeable, the experience was marred by the small, crowded space and inconsistent service. The noise level was quite loud, making it difficult to have a conversation. The atmosphere, while lively, didn't align with my preference for a more relaxed dining experience. The limited food options were also a letdown. Overall, it didn't meet my expectations for a comfortable and enjoyable evening out."
