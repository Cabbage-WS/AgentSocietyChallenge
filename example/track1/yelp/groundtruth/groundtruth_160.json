  "review": "I recently visited Wawa at 3942 N US Highway 301, and overall, I had a pretty good experience. The store was clean, and the staff was friendly and efficient, which are qualities I really appreciate. I enjoyed the coffee and found the breakfast sandwiches to be quite tasty. While the menu options are somewhat limited, the items they do offer are consistently good. The convenience of having a gas station and a variety of services in one place is a big plus. However, I did notice a bit of a wait during peak hours, which can be a minor inconvenience. Overall, it's a solid choice for a quick stop."
