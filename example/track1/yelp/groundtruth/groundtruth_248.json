  "review": "Bearss Groves is a hidden gem in Tampa, offering a wide variety of fresh and high-quality produce. The prices are very reasonable, and the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, which makes shopping here a pleasure. The market is dog-friendly, adding to the overall enjoyable experience. While the dirt parking lot can be a bit bumpy, especially after rain, it's a minor inconvenience given the quality of the products. I especially appreciate the seasonal items and the fresh juices, which are always a treat. Overall, a great place to pick up fresh, local produce."
