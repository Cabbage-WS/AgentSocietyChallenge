  "review": "I visited Great Clips for a haircut and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service. The staff was friendly and professional, and the online check-in system made the process smooth and convenient. My stylist, Ha Vu, did a fantastic job and took the time to understand my preferences. The haircut was exactly what I was looking for, and the price was very reasonable. While I typically focus on chiropractic and wellness services, Great Clips definitely meets the standards of quality and customer care that I value."
