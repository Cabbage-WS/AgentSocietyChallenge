  "review": "I visited USA International Health and Beauty hoping for a decent manicure, but the experience was disappointing. The technician rushed through the process, and the polish was uneven and messy. I had to ask for a redo, which they reluctantly did, but the quality remained subpar. The service felt unprofessional, and I wouldn't recommend this place based on my experience."
