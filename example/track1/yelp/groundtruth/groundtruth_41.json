The store's unique and varied inventory, including vintage furniture and collectibles, was a delightful surprise. The prices were fair, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. While the store is not very large, it has a well-curated selection that makes every visit interesting. I highly recommend Resale Ranch for anyone looking for unique and high-quality vintage items."
