  "review": "Muscle Maker Grill has a clean and modern environment, which is a plus, and the staff is generally friendly. However, the food quality is hit or miss\u2014some dishes are bland and overcooked, and the prices are a bit steep for what you get. Additionally, the service can be inconsistent, with long wait times and incorrect orders. While it's a good spot for a healthy meal, it doesn't quite meet my expectations for a relaxed and enjoyable dining experience."
