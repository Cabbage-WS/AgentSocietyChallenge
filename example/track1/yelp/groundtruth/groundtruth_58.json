  "review": "I had a mixed experience with The Roof Doctor. On the positive side, Harry and his son were professional and responsive, which is important to me. They fixed a roof leak and applied an aluminum coating efficiently. However, the service was inconsistent. Communication was sometimes delayed, and I heard from other customers that the work quality can be hit or miss. While I appreciate their professionalism, I would recommend checking multiple references and ensuring clear communication before hiring them."
