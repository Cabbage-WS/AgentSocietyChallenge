  "review": "I visited Grantstone Supermarket and was impressed by the wide selection of Asian products and fresh produce. The prices were reasonable, and I found everything I needed for an authentic Asian meal. However, the store's disorganization and strong odor were a bit off-putting. The staff was generally helpful, but the overall atmosphere could use some improvement. Despite these minor issues, I would still recommend this market for its unique and extensive offerings."
