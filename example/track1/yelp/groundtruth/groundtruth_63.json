  "review": "17th Street Market is a gem for those seeking unique and high-quality specialty foods. The variety of international and Asian items, along with the fresh produce, is impressive. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, enhancing the shopping experience. While the recent downsizing and removal of the fish market are disappointing, the market still offers a wide range of high-quality products. It's a bit pricey, but the quality justifies the cost. Overall, a great place to explore and find something new."
