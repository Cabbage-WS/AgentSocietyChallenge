The shop is incredibly clean and welcoming, which is a big plus for me. The staff, especially Shanna and Mikey, were highly professional and made sure I was completely comfortable and satisfied with the process. They provided detailed explanations and aftercare instructions, ensuring I felt confident and well-informed. The selection of jewelry is also impressive, with a wide range of unique and affordable options. Overall, a top-notch experience that I would highly recommend."
