  "review": "I visited Chick-fil-A and while the food was delicious and affordable, the service was a major letdown. The long wait times in the drive-thru and the frequent order inaccuracies were frustrating. The staff was friendly, but the overall experience was marred by poor service and inefficiency. I appreciate the clean and welcoming atmosphere, but the issues with service and wait times make it hard to recommend."
