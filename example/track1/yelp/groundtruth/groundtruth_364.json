  "review": "I visited Pete's Famous Pizza Restaurant for a pizza night, and while the location is convenient and the menu offers a variety of options, my experience was quite disappointing. The pizza was doughy and lacked flavor, which is a significant letdown for someone who values high-quality food. The staff was generally friendly, but the service was slow, and the overall atmosphere was average. The place could benefit from improving the quality of their food and reducing wait times. I would think twice before returning or recommending this place to others."
