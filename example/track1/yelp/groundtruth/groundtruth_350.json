  "review": "Boulton's Pool Service has shown a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, the professional and responsive staff, particularly Marci, have been praised for maintaining a pristine pool. However, the unreliability and poor communication, especially with missed appointments and lack of responsiveness, are concerning. While the quality of service is commendable, these issues with consistency and customer service are significant drawbacks. I appreciate the high-quality maintenance but feel that the service could improve in reliability and communication to fully meet my expectations."
