The prices were very reasonable, making it a great value for the generous portion sizes. The staff was friendly and professional, and the service was fast and efficient. The modern and clean atmosphere added to the overall pleasant dining experience. I particularly enjoyed the chicken shawarma and the variety of sauces. I would definitely recommend Pita Chip to anyone looking for a quick, healthy, and tasty meal."
