  "review": "I had a very disappointing experience with Economy Rent a Car. The service was unprofessional from start to finish, with hidden fees and unfriendly staff. The car I received was in poor condition, which made my trip stressful. The only positive was the shuttle driver, who was friendly, but that wasn't enough to salvage the overall experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
