  "review": "Hotel McCoy is a charming and unique boutique hotel that ticks many of my boxes. The retro aesthetic and artistic touches make it a standout, and the comfortable, clean rooms are a plus. The friendly staff and various amenities, such as the free drinks and entertainment options, add to the overall appeal. While the breakfast options were a bit limited, the overall experience was excellent, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay in Tucson."
