  "review": "I recently visited Lidl on Butler Street in Philadelphia and was thoroughly impressed. The store is clean, well-organized, and offers a wide variety of fresh and high-quality products at very affordable prices. The bakery section was particularly outstanding, with delicious croissants and pretzels. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the self-checkout options made the shopping experience smooth and efficient. I especially appreciated the diverse selection of international items. Overall, Lidl exceeded my expectations, and I will definitely be returning."
