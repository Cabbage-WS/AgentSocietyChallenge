  "review": "I visited Kim's Cleaners for the first time and was disappointed. While the quality of the dry cleaning was good, the customer service was a major letdown. The female owner was quite rude and dismissive, which made the experience unpleasant. Additionally, the prices were higher than I expected for a local cleaner, and they don't accept credit cards for smaller orders, which is inconvenient. Despite the quality, the poor service and high prices make it difficult to recommend."
