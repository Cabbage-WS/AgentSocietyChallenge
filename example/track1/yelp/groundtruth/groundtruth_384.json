  "review": "Cafe Walnut is a charming spot that offers a cozy and inviting atmosphere, perfect for a relaxing breakfast or lunch. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, making the experience even more enjoyable. The food, especially the bagels and coffee, is top-notch and reasonably priced. While the music can sometimes be a bit loud and the upstairs area can be dark, these minor issues do not detract from the overall positive experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience in Philadelphia."
