  "review": "I visited Jack in the Box on 22nd St in Tucson, and while the location has its merits, it fell short of my expectations. The staff was generally friendly, and the place was clean, which is a plus. However, the food quality was inconsistent; my Sourdough Jack was cold and lacked the flavor I was hoping for. The long wait times and a few instances of incorrect orders added to the frustration. For a fast-food joint, the service should be quick and the food should be consistently good, but this visit was a mixed bag. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll be returning anytime soon."
