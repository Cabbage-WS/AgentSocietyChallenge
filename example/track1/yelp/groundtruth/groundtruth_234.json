  "review": "Serenity Salon & Spa offers a wide range of beauty services, and my experience was generally positive. The salon is clean and comfortable, and the staff, especially the hair stylists, are highly skilled and friendly. I particularly enjoyed the attention to detail and the personalized service. However, I did notice some inconsistencies in the quality of nail services and a bit of a wait time, which could be improved. Overall, it's a great place for a relaxing and professional beauty experience."
