  "review": "I visited BAMN Fitness and found it to be a well-equipped and affordable gym with a supportive culture that caters to a wide range of fitness levels. The gym's atmosphere is inclusive and encouraging, which I really appreciate. However, I had a mixed experience with the owner, Sonny. While he was friendly and knowledgeable during the initial sign-up, his behavior later on was a bit off-putting. This contrast with the positive experiences described by other users left me with a somewhat ambivalent feeling. Overall, I still enjoyed my time at the gym, but the owner's inconsistent behavior is a point of concern."
