  "review": "I had high expectations for Michi Ramen, and while the experience was enjoyable, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The ramen was flavorful, but the broth could have been richer. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant. I'll definitely give it another try to explore more of their menu."
