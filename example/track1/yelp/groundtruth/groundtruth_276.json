  "review": "Childrens Orthopedic Specialists in Tucson has been a pleasant surprise. The office staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly, making the entire experience much more comfortable, especially for children. Dr. Vincent and Dr. Henderson are both highly skilled and personable, taking the time to explain medical issues in a way that is easy to understand. The appointments are efficient, and the wait times are minimal. However, I did encounter some issues with communication, which led to a delay in my child's treatment. This was a significant concern, but overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives. Highly recommend for their excellent care and attention to detail."
