  "review": "I had mixed experiences with China King. While the food is generally tasty and reasonably priced, the delivery service has been a source of frustration. My orders have been late multiple times, and the communication from the restaurant is often poor. Additionally, I've encountered greasy and undercooked dishes, which is a major turn-off. Despite the occasional good meal, the inconsistent service and food quality make it hard to give a higher rating."
