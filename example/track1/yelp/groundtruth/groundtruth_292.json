  "review": "I visited Just Desserts & Coffee House with high hopes, especially for the coffee, which is often praised. While the coffee was indeed good and the atmosphere was clean and inviting, the dessert selection was a letdown. The cream puffs were dry and lacked flavor, and the tiramisu was one of the worst I've had. The service was also slow, even though the place wasn't particularly busy. The interactive tables were a neat feature, but they didn't make up for the mediocre desserts and pricing that felt a bit steep for the quality. Overall, it's a place I likely won't return to."
