  "review": "Cake Life Bake Shop is a charming and artistic bakery with a lot to offer. The baked goods, especially the cupcakes and pastries, are truly delicious and made with high-quality ingredients. The atmosphere is clean and welcoming, and the staff is generally friendly and helpful. However, the prices are a bit on the higher side, which might be a drawback for some. Despite this, it's a great spot for special occasions and those looking for unique and creative flavors. The lack of a happy hour and the occasional limited selection are minor downsides, but overall, it's a solid choice for a treat."
