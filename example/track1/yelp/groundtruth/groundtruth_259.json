  "review": "I visited Wendy's at 6441 E. 22nd St. in Tucson, and while the friendly staff and clean environment were appreciated, the experience fell short in several key areas. The long wait times, both in the drive-thru and inside, were frustrating, and the food quality was inconsistent, with some items arriving cold and undercooked. The lack of outdoor seating and the casual, fast-food atmosphere didn't align with my preference for a more relaxed dining experience. While the Frosty was a highlight, the overall experience wasn't up to my standards."
