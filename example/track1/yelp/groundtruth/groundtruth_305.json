  "review": "SOHO Juice - Tampa is a refreshing find for health-conscious diners. The menu offers a variety of fresh, organic options like Acai bowls and smoothies, which align well with my preference for fresh ingredients and a healthy diet. The atmosphere is inviting and perfect for a quick, casual visit. While it doesn't serve Mediterranean cuisine or offer BYOB, the quality and freshness of the food make it a worthwhile stop. The reasonable prices and takeout options are also a plus."
