  "review": "I had mixed feelings about Sansom Cleaners. While the alterations were top-notch and the staff were friendly and professional, the smoky smell on my clothes after cleaning was a significant downside. The prices were also higher than I'm comfortable with, especially for regular dry cleaning. Additionally, the long turn-around times and issues with stain removal made the overall experience less than satisfactory. I appreciate the quality when it comes to delicate items, but the negatives outweigh the positives for me."
