  "review": "I recently visited Tashiology Skincare for a facial and a waxing session, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. Tashua, the owner, was incredibly professional and made me feel very comfortable throughout the process. The quality of the services was top-notch, and I appreciated the use of natural products. The aftercare kit for first-time clients was a nice touch and added value to my visit. The business is also wheelchair accessible and accepts credit cards, which is convenient. I\u2019m definitely coming back and recommending this place to my friends."
