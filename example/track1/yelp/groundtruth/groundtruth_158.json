  "review": "Red's Hoagies & Groceries has a lot going for it, especially its quick service and friendly staff, which are qualities I really appreciate. The breakfast hoagies are particularly delicious, and the prices are reasonable, making it a great spot for a quick, satisfying meal. However, the inconsistency in food quality, particularly the occasional stale rolls, and the shop's tendency to close earlier than advertised, are significant drawbacks. The environment could also use some improvement, as the shop feels a bit unkempt at times. Overall, it's a decent place, but it falls short of being a favorite due to these issues."
