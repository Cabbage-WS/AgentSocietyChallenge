  "review": "I visited Rai Rai Ramen based on recommendations and had a mixed experience. The ramen, especially the miso and shoyu, was delicious and rich, which was a highlight. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was clean and modern. However, the quality of some appetizers was disappointing, and the prices seemed a bit high for the overall experience. Despite these issues, it's a decent place for a good bowl of ramen."
