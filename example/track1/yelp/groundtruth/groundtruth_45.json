The takoyaki balls were perfectly cooked, with a soft, pillowy batter and just the right amount of octopus inside. The katsu curry was also delicious, rich, and flavorful. While the experience was great, I did feel the prices were a bit high for a food truck. Overall, I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a taste of authentic Japanese street food."
