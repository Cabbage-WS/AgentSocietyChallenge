  "review": "The US Post Office on Grays Ferry Ave has a few bright spots, such as the helpful and efficient service from specific employees like Bill and the tattooed worker. However, the overall experience is marred by frequent service issues, such as lost packages and poor communication. The facility is also quite dirty and poorly maintained, which is a significant letdown. While the location and parking are convenient, the long wait times and unfriendly staff, especially the female employees, make it difficult to recommend this post office."
