  "review": "Ice Cold Air Discount Auto Repair is a solid choice for auto repairs in Tampa. The staff, particularly Jay and Ashley, are friendly and professional, which is a key factor for me. The pricing is fair, and they do a good job of explaining the work needed, which helps build trust. However, there have been some issues with communication, and I've heard a few complaints about overcharging from other customers. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall experience is positive, and they seem to do competent and thorough work. I would recommend them, but I'd also suggest getting a second opinion for major repairs to avoid any potential overcharging."
