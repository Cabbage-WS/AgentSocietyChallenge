  "review": "I visited Gail's Caribbean & American Cuisine with high hopes after reading the positive reviews. The food, especially the doubles, was indeed fresh and flavorful, which was a pleasant surprise. The service was generally friendly, and the casual atmosphere was comfortable. However, I did notice some inconsistencies in the food quality, particularly with the curry chicken, which was a bit undercooked and lacked flavor. Additionally, the seating area could use a bit more attention to cleanliness. Overall, it was a decent experience, but there's room for improvement in both food consistency and cleanliness."
