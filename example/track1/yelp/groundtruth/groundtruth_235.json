  "review": "Desert Dream Ice Cream is a delightful find in Tucson, offering a wide array of delicious and fresh ice cream flavors. The staff is generally friendly and welcoming, making the experience enjoyable. The shop is clean and has a welcoming atmosphere, perfect for a family outing or a relaxing afternoon. While the prices are reasonable for the quality, I did notice that the flavors are not always visible, which could be a minor inconvenience. Overall, it's a great spot for a sweet treat, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for high-quality ice cream."
