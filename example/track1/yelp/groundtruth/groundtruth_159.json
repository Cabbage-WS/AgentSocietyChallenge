  "review": "I visited Abbolone and Scullin Realty to inquire about a property, and the experience was underwhelming. The office was not well-maintained, and the staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful. They failed to provide clear information about the properties I was interested in, and the overall atmosphere was unprofessional. Given the mixed reviews from other users and the lack of detailed information on their services, I would not recommend this real estate agency."
