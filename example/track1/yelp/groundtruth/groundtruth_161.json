  "review": "I visited The Number One Fast Food with low expectations after reading mixed reviews, and unfortunately, those expectations were met. The food was inconsistent; my burger was overcooked and lacked flavor, which is a dealbreaker for me. While the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming, the quality of the food is crucial, and this place fell short. I appreciate the late hours and unique Colombian flavors, but the poor cooking skills of the staff are a major letdown. I won't be returning until they address these issues."
