  "review": "Kimchi Time offers a delightful Korean dining experience with flavorful dishes and warm service. The kimchi jeon was a standout, and the bibimbap was hearty and satisfying. While the portions could be slightly larger, the quality of the food and the friendly atmosphere make it worth a visit."
