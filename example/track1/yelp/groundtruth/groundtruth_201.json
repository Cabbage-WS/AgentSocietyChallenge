  "review": "I had a terrible experience at Best Buy Furniture. The staff was unhelpful, and the delivery process was a nightmare. I ordered a sofa in March, and after multiple delays and broken promises, I still haven't received it. The customer service was appalling, and I felt completely ignored. I won't be returning or recommending this place to anyone."
