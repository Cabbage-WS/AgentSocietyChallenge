  "review": "The All Souls Procession in Tucson is an absolute must-see event that exceeded all my expectations. The unique blend of Day of the Dead traditions and local culture creates a truly magical and immersive experience. The atmosphere is electric, with creative and artistic displays that are both visually stunning and emotionally moving. Despite the crowds, the event is well-organized and family-friendly, making it a wonderful experience for all ages. The grand finale, with the burning of the urn and the performances, was a highlight I won't soon forget. Highly recommend!"
