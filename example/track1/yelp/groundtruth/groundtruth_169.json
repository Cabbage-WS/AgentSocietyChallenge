  "review": "The Schuylkill Expressway is a commuter's nightmare. Endless traffic, unpredictable congestion, and a design that feels like it was built for a bygone era make this road a constant source of frustration. While the views of the city skyline can be breathtaking, they\u2019re hardly worth the hours wasted in gridlock. Avoid this road if you can, or prepare for a journey that feels more like purgatory than an expressway."
