  "review": "I recently visited Domino's Pizza on W Waters Ave, and I was thoroughly impressed. The staff, especially Juanita and Tessa, were incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to ensure my order was perfect. The pizzas, particularly the hand-tossed pepperoni with extra cheese, were delicious and fresh. The store was clean, and the atmosphere was welcoming. While there were a couple of minor issues with the crust being a bit soft, the overall experience was excellent, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great pizza experience."
