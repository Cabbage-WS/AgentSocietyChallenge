  "review": "I visited Taqueria El Rapido and was thoroughly impressed. The food was delicious and fresh, particularly the carne asada burrito, which was well-prepared and flavorful. The staff was friendly and efficient, and the food truck and seating area were clean and welcoming. The prices were reasonable, making it a great value for the quality of the food. While the tacos were on the smaller side, the overall experience was excellent, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great Mexican food in Tucson."
