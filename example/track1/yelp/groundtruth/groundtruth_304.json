  "review": "I visited Hyde Park Tan Lounge and had a mixed experience. The facility was clean, and the Versa Spa booth provided a high-quality spray tan, which I appreciated. However, the billing issues and poor customer service were major letdowns. I was overcharged and had to argue to get a refund. The staff seemed unprofessional and unresponsive, which made the experience less enjoyable. Given these issues, I can't recommend this place highly, despite the good aspects."
