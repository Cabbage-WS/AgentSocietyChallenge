  "review": "I had a terrible experience at Ed's Pizza House. The service was unprofessional, and the food was disappointing. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, but it arrived cold and with the wrong toppings. When I called to complain, the staff was rude and unhelpful. I won't be returning or recommending this place to anyone."
