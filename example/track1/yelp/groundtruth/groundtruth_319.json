  "review": "I visited Genji Sushi Bar & Izakaya and had a mixed experience. The ramen, especially the Truffle Butter Miso, was delicious and lived up to the hype. The staff was friendly and the takeout process was smooth, which is a plus. However, the prices were a bit steep, and the portion sizes were smaller than expected, which didn't provide great value for the money. Additionally, the quality of some dishes, like the pork in the ramen, was a bit inconsistent. Overall, it's a decent spot, but it could use some improvements in pricing and portion sizes."
