  "review": "I had mixed feelings about my experience with Chef Joseph Poon. On one hand, the hands-on cooking class was engaging, and the generous portions of food were a plus. However, the overpricing and Chef Poon's unprofessional behavior, including some inappropriate comments, were significant turn-offs. The dining area was also uninviting, which detracted from the overall experience. While the cooking class itself had some redeeming qualities, the negative aspects made it hard to fully enjoy the visit."
