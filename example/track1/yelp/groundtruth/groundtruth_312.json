  "review": "I visited the 7-Eleven on Filbert Avenue, and while it's convenient for late-night stops, the experience was quite disappointing. The staff seemed disinterested and slow, which made the wait times longer than necessary. The store itself wasn't very clean, and the overall atmosphere was not pleasant. While the location is handy, the poor service and cleanliness are significant downsides. I wouldn't recommend this particular 7-Eleven for a regular stop."
