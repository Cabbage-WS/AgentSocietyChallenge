  "review": "I visited Ruth's Chris Steak House for a special occasion, and while the steaks were indeed outstanding and cooked to perfection, the overall experience fell short of my expectations. The service was inconsistent; our waiter was inattentive, and we had to wait a long time for drinks and food. The high prices did not justify the mediocre service and cramped seating, which made it difficult to enjoy the meal. Although the food quality was excellent, the overall experience was disappointing, and I'm not sure I would return."
