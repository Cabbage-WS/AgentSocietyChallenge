  "review": "I visited Paul's Pizza and had a mixed experience. While the food, especially the chicken cheesesteak, was quite tasty and the portions were generous, the service was a major letdown. The staff seemed disorganized and unhelpful, especially when it came to handling my order. The cash-only policy also felt inconvenient. Given the issues with service and the lack of modern amenities like credit card acceptance, I can't give it a higher rating. However, the food quality and value for money do keep it from being a complete miss."
