  "review": "I visited Bella Locs hoping for a high-quality and friendly experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. While Trina B was praised for her attention to detail and customer service, my experience was marred by poor communication and long wait times. The staff was not as friendly as I had hoped, and the overall atmosphere felt rushed and unprofessional. Additionally, the quality of the hair products did not justify the high prices. I recommend potential customers to carefully consider these aspects before visiting."
