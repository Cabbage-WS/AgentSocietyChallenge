  "review": "I visited this McDonald's on Oracle Road in Tucson, and it was a deeply disappointing experience. The service was incredibly poor; the staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, which is a major turn-off for me. My order was incorrect, and when I tried to address the issue, the cashier was rude and dismissive. The food itself was cold and unappetizing, and the restaurant was not as clean as I would expect from a fast-food chain. Given my previous bad experience with incorrect orders and poor customer service, this visit only confirmed my decision to avoid this location in the future."
