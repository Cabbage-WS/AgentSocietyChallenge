  "review": "I visited Triple Joy for a quick breakfast, and while the place is clean and offers takeout, the experience was underwhelming. The service was average, and the food, while not terrible, didn't stand out. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, and it was okay, but nothing special. The prices seemed reasonable, and the staff was friendly but not particularly attentive. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick bite, but it didn't meet my expectations for a memorable meal."
