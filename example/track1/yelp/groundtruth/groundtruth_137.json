  "review": "I had a mixed experience at Olive Garden. The food was delicious, with standout dishes like the breadsticks and pasta that were both flavorful and well-prepared. The restaurant was clean and welcoming, which added to the overall pleasant dining experience. However, the service was a bit hit-or-miss; while our server was friendly, the attentiveness varied throughout the meal. Additionally, the restaurant was quite crowded and noisy, which detracted from the ambiance. Despite these issues, the value for the quality of food was reasonable, making it a solid choice for a casual Italian dinner."
