  "review": "I had a mixed experience at Kaminsky Dental. While the staff was friendly and the office was clean, I felt pressured into a procedure I wasn't entirely comfortable with. The billing process was confusing, and I ended up with an unexpected bill. I wish they had been more transparent about costs upfront."
