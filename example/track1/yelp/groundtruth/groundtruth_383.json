  "review": "I visited La Teresita Tex Mex and Bakery and found it to be a mixed experience. The food was generally good, with a variety of vegetarian options that were both flavorful and reasonably priced. The staff was friendly and accommodating, which made the dining experience pleasant. However, I noticed that the menu was somewhat limited, and the restaurant ran out of a few items by the time I visited. Additionally, the lack of clear operating hours was a bit confusing. Overall, it's a decent place to grab a quick, affordable meal, but it could benefit from a more consistent menu and clearer communication about its hours."
