  "review": "Quebedeaux Buick GMC in Tucson offers a mixed experience. While the dealership has a professional and knowledgeable staff, which is a plus, the overall service falls short of my expectations. The lack of clear communication and hidden fees are significant drawbacks. The cleanliness and comfort of the facilities are commendable, but the reliability issues reported by other customers are concerning. I appreciate the customer-centric approach, but the inconsistencies in service and pricing make it difficult to recommend this dealership without reservations."
