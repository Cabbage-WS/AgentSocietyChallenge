  "review": "I visited Panda Express for a quick lunch, and while the place is casual and convenient, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The service was a bit hit-or-miss; some staff were friendly, but others seemed unengaged. The food, while generally tasty, was often served lukewarm and lacked the freshness I was hoping for. The honey sesame chicken was a highlight, but the overall experience was marred by the inconsistency in service and food quality. Additionally, the dining area could use some cleaning, as a few tables were cluttered and unappealing. It's a decent spot for a quick bite, but there's room for improvement."
