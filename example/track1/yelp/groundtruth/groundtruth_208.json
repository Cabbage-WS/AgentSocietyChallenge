  "review": "I visited Ichicoro Imoto in Tampa, hoping for a great Japanese dining experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The ramen was overly salty and lacked flavor, which was disappointing given the high prices. The service was also inconsistent; while some staff members were friendly, others seemed uninterested and unhelpful. The fried chicken was a bright spot, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience. The ambiance was nice, but the food and service issues were too significant to overlook."
