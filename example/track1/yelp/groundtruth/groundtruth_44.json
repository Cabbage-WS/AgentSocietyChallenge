  "review": "New China Court offers a pleasant dining experience with friendly and efficient service, which is a significant plus for me. The food quality is generally good, with standout dishes like the egg rolls and General Tso's chicken. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, making it a good value for money. However, the restaurant can be a bit greasy and dingy, and it gets uncomfortably hot during the summer, which are minor drawbacks. Overall, it's a solid choice for a Chinese meal, and I would recommend it to others."
