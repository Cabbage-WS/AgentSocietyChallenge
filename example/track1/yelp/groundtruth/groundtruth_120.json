  "review": "Sahara Indian Cuisine offers a mix of positive and negative aspects that align with my preferences. The food quality is generally good, with dishes like Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan being particularly delicious. The staff is friendly and accommodating, which is a plus. However, the inconsistency in food quality and occasional long delivery times are significant drawbacks. While it's a good option for a casual, affordable Indian meal, it falls short of the high standards I expect for fine dining experiences."
