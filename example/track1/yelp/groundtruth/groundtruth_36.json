The staff was friendly, and the place was clean, which is always a plus. However, the wait time was longer than expected, and the quality seemed a bit inconsistent, which was a letdown. The prices were reasonable, but the service could use some improvement. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick, casual meal, but it doesn't quite meet my higher standards for reliability and consistency."
