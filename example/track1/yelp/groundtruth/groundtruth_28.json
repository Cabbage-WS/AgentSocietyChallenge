  "review": "I visited Modern Vac & Sew Centers for some alterations and was pleased with the quality of the work. The staff was knowledgeable and the pricing was reasonable. However, the turnaround time was a bit longer than I expected, which was a minor inconvenience. Overall, it's a decent place for sewing and appliance repairs, but there's room for improvement in terms of communication and speed."
