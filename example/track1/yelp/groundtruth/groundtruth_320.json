While the variety of crepes and the fresh ingredients were appealing, the crepe I ordered was somewhat stale and the portion size was smaller than expected for the price. The staff was friendly, but the overall quality of the food fell short of my expectations. I appreciate the value and the options, but the execution needs improvement."
