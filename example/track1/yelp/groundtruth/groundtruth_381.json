  "review": "I recently visited Box Of Cubans in Tampa, and I was quite impressed. The Cuban sandwiches and empanadas are truly delicious, and everything is made fresh to order, which is a big plus. The owners are very friendly and welcoming, making the experience even better. However, the limited seating and the occasional long wait times during peak hours were a bit of a downside. Despite these minor issues, the quality of the food and the service make it a great spot to visit, especially for those craving authentic Cuban cuisine."
