  "review": "Party City of Tampa has a lot to offer, especially for someone looking for a wide variety of party supplies and costumes. The staff were generally helpful and attentive, which is a plus. However, the store's layout is quite confusing, and the narrow aisles made shopping a bit uncomfortable. The parking situation is also a significant drawback, with a small lot that often fills up quickly. While the prices are reasonable and there are often good deals, the quality of some products, particularly costumes, could be better. Overall, it's a useful place for party essentials, but the experience could be improved with better organization and customer service consistency."
