  "review": "I had high hopes for the Masters Inn Fairgrounds, but my experience was a major letdown. The room was infested with roaches, and the furniture was old and falling apart. The staff was unhelpful and seemed disinterested in addressing the issues. The overall cleanliness and maintenance were poor, which made the stay very uncomfortable. Given my preference for well-maintained and clean environments, this place did not meet any of my standards. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially families or those looking for a pleasant stay."
