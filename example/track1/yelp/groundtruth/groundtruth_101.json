  "review": "I visited Cosi for lunch and was quite disappointed. The food, while flavorful, was served cold, and the staff was unhelpful when I requested that it be heated up. The service was slow, and the staff seemed disinterested, which made for an unpleasant dining experience. Despite the convenient location and generally good reviews for some items, the inconsistencies in food quality and the unfriendly service made it a hard visit to recommend."
