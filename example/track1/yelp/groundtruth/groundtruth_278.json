  "review": "I visited Perkins Restaurant & Bakery for breakfast with my family, and while the experience was mixed, there were both positives and negatives. The restaurant is child-friendly, which is a big plus, and the staff was generally friendly and accommodating. However, the service was a bit inconsistent, and the food quality varied. The breakfast items were decent, but not exceptional. The atmosphere was clean and welcoming, and the prices were reasonable. However, the cleanliness issues and some undercooked dishes did not meet my expectations for a quality dining experience. Overall, it's a decent spot for a casual family breakfast, but it has room for improvement in terms of service and food consistency."
