  "review": "I had a decent experience at Laser Wolf. The food was flavorful, especially the salatim and hummus, but the grilled items were a bit underwhelming for the price. The atmosphere was casual and fun, though the loud music made it hard to have a conversation. Overall, it was a good meal, but not quite as impressive as I expected."
