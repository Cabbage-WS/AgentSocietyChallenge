  "review": "I had a mixed experience at ACME Markets. The store is clean and has a decent selection, but the staff could be more attentive and friendly. I found the prices to be reasonable, but the checkout process was a bit slow. Overall, it's an okay grocery store, but there's room for improvement in customer service."
