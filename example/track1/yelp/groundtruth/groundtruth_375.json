  "review": "Catalina Cleaners has a mixed reputation, and my experience aligns with the negative reviews. While the quality of cleaning seems to be good, the customer service is a significant issue. The staff can be unprofessional and rude, and there have been instances of price discrepancies, which is unacceptable. Additionally, the business is not currently open, which is a major inconvenience. I would recommend finding a more reliable and customer-friendly alternative."
