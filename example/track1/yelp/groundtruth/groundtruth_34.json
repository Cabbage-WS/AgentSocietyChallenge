  "review": "I visited Michaels in Tucson and, while it had a few positive aspects, it fell short in several areas that are important to me. The store layout was cluttered and disorganized, making it difficult to find items, which is a big letdown for someone who appreciates unique and well-curated shopping experiences. The staff were generally helpful, but the long wait times at the checkout were frustrating, and the cleanliness of the store, particularly the restrooms, was disappointing. While I found some unique items, the overall experience didn't meet my expectations for a quirky and enjoyable shopping trip."
