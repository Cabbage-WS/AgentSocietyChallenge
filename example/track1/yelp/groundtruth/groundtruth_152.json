  "review": "I visited Jerry Bob's for breakfast and found the experience to be average. The service was friendly, but the food quality was inconsistent. My eggs were overcooked, and the hash browns were a bit mushy. While the prices are reasonable, the overall experience didn't stand out, and I might try somewhere else next time."
