  "review": "Studio510 is a pleasant surprise in the beauty salon world. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the staff, particularly Derek, are highly skilled and knowledgeable. I received a fantastic haircut and blowout, and the prices were reasonable. The only minor downsides were a slightly longer wait time and a bit of strong chemical fumes, but overall, the experience was excellent, and I would definitely return."
