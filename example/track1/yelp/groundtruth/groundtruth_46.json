  "review": "Mr. Empanada offers a unique and tasty experience with their fresh, made-to-order empanadas. The beef and cheese empanada was flavorful and satisfying, though a bit on the pricey side. The guava and cream cheese empanada, however, was a standout, with its perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess. Overall, a great spot for a quick, delicious bite."
