  "review": "Alla Spina offers a unique and trendy atmosphere that is perfect for a night out with friends. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making the experience enjoyable despite some issues. However, the food quality was inconsistent, and the prices felt a bit steep for the portion sizes. The noise level was also quite high, which made it difficult to have a relaxed conversation. Overall, it's a good spot for a casual night out, but there's room for improvement in terms of consistency and value."
