  "review": "I visited Luxury Auto Mall to look for a new car, but the experience was nothing short of disappointing. The dealership engaged in unethical practices, such as listing fake vehicles and using bait-and-switch tactics. The staff was unprofessional and unresponsive, and the entire process was filled with hidden fees and unclear terms. The quality of the vehicles was also questionable, with several customers reporting issues with their purchases. This dealership is more focused on making a quick buck than on providing a positive customer experience. I strongly advise anyone to steer clear of Luxury Auto Mall."
