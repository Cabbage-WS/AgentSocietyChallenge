  "review": "Posh Nails & Spa has a mix of qualities that both impress and disappoint. On the positive side, the salon is clean and the staff are generally friendly and professional, which aligns with my preference for a clean and welcoming environment. The range of polish choices and the quality of the manicures and pedicures are also notable. However, the inconsistent service and long wait times, even with an appointment, are significant drawbacks. These issues, along with reports of rudeness from some staff members, make it hard to fully recommend this salon. While the overall experience is decent, there's room for improvement in customer service and efficiency."
