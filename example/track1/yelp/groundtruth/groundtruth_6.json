  "review": "Just Desserts & Coffee House has a unique and fun atmosphere with its interactive tables, which are a great way to pass the time. The desserts I tried were decent, but not exceptional, and the service was friendly. While the concept is cool, the quality of the desserts didn't quite match the experience."
