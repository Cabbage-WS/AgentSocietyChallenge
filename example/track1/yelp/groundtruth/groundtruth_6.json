  "review": "Twirls Frozen Yogurt is a place that caught my attention due to its bright and inviting atmosphere. The variety of delicious frozen yogurt flavors, especially the tart and pomegranate raspberry sorbet, is impressive, and the extensive topping selection, including fresh fruits and unique options like butterscotch chips, is a real plus. However, the service can be hit or miss, with some staff being friendly and helpful while others are less attentive. The pricing model, which charges by weight, can be steep, especially if you overfill your cup. Despite these drawbacks, the overall experience is still enjoyable, but there's room for improvement in consistency and value."
