  "review": "I had high expectations for La Parrilla Suiza based on its reputation, but my experience was just average. The food lacked the bold flavors I was hoping for, and the service was a bit slow. While the atmosphere was pleasant, it didn't make up for the mediocre meal. I might give it another try, but there are better options for authentic Mexican food in Tucson."
