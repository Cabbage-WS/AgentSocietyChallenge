  "review": "Pizza Luna is a pleasant surprise, especially for a place in Tucson. The pizza crust is perfectly crispy and the fresh ingredients, particularly the tomatoes and cheese, really elevate the dishes. The service is friendly and attentive, making the dining experience enjoyable. While the salads were a bit bland and the prices slightly high, the overall quality of the food and the charming atmosphere make it a worthwhile visit. I particularly enjoyed the variety of specialty pizzas and the fresh, homemade lemonade. However, I wish there were more dessert options and a bit more consistency in the pizza quality. Overall, it's a solid choice for a great pizza night out."
