The staff was friendly and attentive, making my dining experience enjoyable. The deli's clean and welcoming atmosphere added to the overall positive vibe. While the space can get a bit crowded during peak hours, it didn't detract from the quality of the food or service. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great deli experience."
