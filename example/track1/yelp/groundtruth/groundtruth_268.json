  "review": "I visited Foxchase Laundromat hoping for a clean and reliable service, but my experience was mixed. While the facility was clean and well-maintained, and there were plenty of available machines, the customer service was a significant letdown. I encountered communication issues when trying to address a concern, and the staff seemed disinterested in helping. The drop-off service also left much to be desired, with a bleach stain on one of my items. Although the place is generally efficient, the poor service and lack of attention to detail are major drawbacks."
