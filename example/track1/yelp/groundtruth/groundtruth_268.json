  "review": "Party City of Tampa has a decent selection of party supplies and costumes, but the store layout can be confusing and the parking situation is frustrating. The staff were helpful when I needed assistance, but the overall experience felt a bit chaotic. It's a good place for last-minute party needs, but I wouldn't call it a top-tier shopping experience."
