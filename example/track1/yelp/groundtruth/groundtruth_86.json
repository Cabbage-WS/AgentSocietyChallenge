  "review": "I visited Harry's Natural Food Store and found it to be a mixed bag. The store offers a wide range of natural and organic products, which is a plus, and the staff seemed knowledgeable. However, the customer service was hit-or-miss; some staff members were unengaged and unapproachable, which made the shopping experience less enjoyable. Additionally, the prices were higher than I expected, and the store's outdated appearance didn't add to the overall appeal. While I appreciate the quality of the products, the high prices and inconsistent service make it hard to recommend wholeheartedly."
