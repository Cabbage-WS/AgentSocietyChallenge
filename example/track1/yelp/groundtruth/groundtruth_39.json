  "review": "Trident Grill is a fantastic spot for some delicious American and seafood dishes. The mac and cheese and fish and chips were both outstanding, and the appetizers like fried pickles and hummus were fresh and satisfying. The staff was generally friendly and attentive, making the dining experience enjoyable. The atmosphere is cozy and perfect for watching sports, and the prices are reasonable, especially during happy hour. While there were a few instances of slow service, the overall experience was very positive, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal in Tucson."
