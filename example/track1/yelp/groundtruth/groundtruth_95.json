  "review": "I visited Jalapeno Mexican Grill with some reservations after reading mixed reviews. While the service was friendly and the atmosphere welcoming, the food quality was a letdown. The guacamole was fresh, but the main dishes, like the steak, were overpriced and lacked flavor. The long wait times further dampened the experience. Given my past negative experiences with poor service and low-quality food, I found this visit to be a disappointing one. I would recommend trying other Mexican restaurants in the area for a more consistent and satisfying meal."
