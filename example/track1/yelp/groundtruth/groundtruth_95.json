  "review": "Kiwami Ramen and Sushi offers a solid dining experience with a cozy atmosphere and decent food. The ramen broth was flavorful, though the portion felt a bit small for the price. The sushi was fresh and well-prepared, making it a good choice for both ramen and sushi lovers. Service was friendly, and the overall vibe was welcoming."
