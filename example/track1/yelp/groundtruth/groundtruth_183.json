  "review": "I visited Los Betos and was disappointed by my experience. The food quality was subpar, with dry potatoes and old, burnt meat, which is a major issue for me. The staff was also quite rude, which made the overall dining experience unpleasant. Additionally, the business only accepts cash and charges ATM fees, which is a significant inconvenience. Given the poor food quality and unfriendly service, I cannot recommend this place and will not be returning."
