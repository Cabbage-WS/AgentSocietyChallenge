  "review": "I visited Tony's Luke, and while the idea of a Philly cheesesteak sounded great, the experience fell short. The cheesesteak was bland and dry, and the bread was stale. The food was overpriced, especially considering the quality. The service was hit or miss; some staff were friendly, but the overall experience was disappointing. I would recommend trying other options for a better meal."
