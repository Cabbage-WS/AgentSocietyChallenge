  "review": "I visited Zento Contemporary Japanese Cuisine with high hopes, but my experience was disappointing. The service was slow and inattentive, with long wait times for both seating and our orders. The food, while fresh, was overpriced for the portion sizes, and the ambiance, though trendy, felt cramped and noisy. Given my past experiences with poor service and value, Zento did not meet my expectations."
