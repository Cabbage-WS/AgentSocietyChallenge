  "review": "I visited \"Steve & Dominic's Auto Repair\" and was thoroughly impressed. The mechanics were knowledgeable, honest, and provided detailed explanations for the repairs needed. They communicated clearly throughout the process, which made me feel confident in their work. The prices were fair, and the service was efficient. This is a far cry from the unreliable and poorly communicative experiences I've had at other auto shops. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for trustworthy and reliable auto repair in Philadelphia."
