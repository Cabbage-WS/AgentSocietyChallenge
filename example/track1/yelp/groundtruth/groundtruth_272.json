  "review": "I visited The Olde City Day School to evaluate it for my child, and while there are some positive aspects, the overall experience was mixed. The facilities are clean and well-maintained, and the extra curricular activities like yoga and art seem like a great addition. However, the main issue is the lack of communication from the administration, which is a dealbreaker for me. Additionally, I heard concerns about the food quality and placement issues from other parents. For a day care, reliable and clear communication is crucial, and it seems to be lacking here. I would recommend parents to look elsewhere for a more transparent and responsive option."
