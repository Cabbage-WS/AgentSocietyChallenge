The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, which made the experience even better. The flavors are diverse and delicious, with natural ingredients that aren't overly sweet. While the long lines and parking issues can be a bit of a hassle, the quality and taste of the products make it worth the wait. Overall, it's a great spot for a refreshing treat."
