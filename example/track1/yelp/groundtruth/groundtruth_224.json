  "review": "I had a decent experience at this Target. The store was clean and well-organized, and I found most of what I needed. The staff was friendly and helpful when I asked for assistance. However, the self-checkout lines were a bit frustrating during peak times, and I wish there were more registers open. Overall, it's a convenient location with a good selection."
