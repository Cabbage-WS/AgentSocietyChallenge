  "review": "I had a great experience at Yolk White & Associates. The food was fresh and delicious, especially the omelets and frittatas, which were cooked to perfection. The owner, Dylan, was incredibly friendly and went out of his way to make us comfortable, even providing shade from the sun with his truck. While the menu is a bit limited and the wait can be long during peak hours, the quality of the food and the exceptional service more than make up for it. The only downside is that they are cash-only, which can be a bit of a hassle. Overall, a fantastic spot for a hearty breakfast in a scenic location."
