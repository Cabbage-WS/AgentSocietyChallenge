  "review": "I visited Wawa on a busy day and was disappointed by the overall experience. The wait times were excruciatingly long, even though the store wasn't overly crowded. The staff seemed understaffed and unengaged, which made the service slow and less than satisfactory. While the location is convenient and the store is generally clean, the food options did not align with my preference for healthy, tasty meals. The presence of homeless individuals around the entrance also added to the discomfort. I hope they can improve their staffing and service quality in the future."
