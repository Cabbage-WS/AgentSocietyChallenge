The service was exceptional, with friendly and attentive staff who made us feel well-cared for. The food was simply outstanding, from the rich and flavorful beef bourguignon to the heavenly almond croissants. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece, and the pastries were some of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend Le Boudoir for anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience."
