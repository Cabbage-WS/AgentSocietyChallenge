  "review": "I visited DK Sushi for a quick lunch and found the experience to be decent but not exceptional. The sushi was fresh, and the presentation was aesthetically pleasing, but the portions felt a bit small for the price. The rice was slightly underseasoned, which was a minor letdown. Overall, it's a good option for a quick sushi fix, but I wouldn't consider it a standout in the area."
