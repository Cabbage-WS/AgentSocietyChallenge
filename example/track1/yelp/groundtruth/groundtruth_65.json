  "review": "Rizzo Ice Rink offers a fun and affordable experience, especially for families and children, which aligns with my appreciation for recreational venues that are welcoming and budget-friendly. However, the condition of the ice and the occasional rudeness from staff detract from the overall experience. While the rink is generally well-maintained and not too crowded, the patches of wet or dirty ice can make skating challenging. Despite these issues, the rink still provides a good atmosphere and is a decent spot for a relaxed outing."
