  "review": "I had a decent experience at Beijing. The food was flavorful and the delivery was prompt, which I appreciated. The sesame chicken was particularly delicious, and the portion sizes were generous. While it wasn't the most exceptional Chinese food I've ever had, it was solid and worth trying if you're in the area."
