The place is very clean and the variety of activities is impressive, which kept my child entertained. However, the staff's customer service was hit-or-miss; some were friendly, but others seemed indifferent. The pricing, especially for additional items like socks, felt a bit steep. Overall, it's a fun place, but there's room for improvement in terms of service and value."
