  "review": "The FastSnail USB-C Extension Charging Cable for the Nintendo Switch is a mixed bag. It offers a stable and reliable connection once set up, which is a step up from the default Nintendo Dock. However, the initial setup issues, such as the cable not staying in place, were frustrating and required some troubleshooting. The build quality seems decent, but the price point is a bit high for what you get. It\u2019s functional but not without its quirks."
