  "review": "These mini wire brushes are a decent value for the price, and they do a good job at cleaning rust and tight spaces. However, the plastic handles are quite flimsy and can break if you apply too much pressure, which is a significant downside. While they are useful for lighter tasks, I found them lacking in durability for more demanding jobs. The set is still handy to have around, but I wish the build quality was a bit better."
