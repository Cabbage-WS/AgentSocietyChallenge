  "review": "I needed a reliable run capacitor for a project, and the Packard 370 Volt Round Run Capacitor 45+5 MFD did the job well. It's a solid, well-built component that seems to be of good quality, and the price is reasonable for the specifications. While I haven't had it long enough to comment on long-term reliability, my initial experience has been positive."
