  "review": "The Fantasycart Fiberglass Cloth is a solid product with impressive durability and resistance to fire and chemicals, which are key attributes I value. However, the cloth is quite difficult to wet out, especially with epoxy, which can make it challenging to work with. Additionally, the product arrives folded, leading to creases that can affect its usability. Despite these issues, the price is reasonable, and it's effective for boat repairs and similar projects. Overall, it's a good product, but the usability issues prevent it from getting a higher rating."
