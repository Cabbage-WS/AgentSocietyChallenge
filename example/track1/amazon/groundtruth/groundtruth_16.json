  "review": "I was quite pleased with the Performance Guitar Capo. The build quality is solid, with a zinc alloy body and a stainless-steel spring that provides excellent pressure across all strings, preventing any unwanted buzzing. It's easy to use and adjust, even with one hand, which is a significant plus. The silicone padding is a nice touch, protecting my guitar from scratches. The only minor downside is that the rubber part might wear out over time, but for the price, it's a great value and definitely meets my expectations."
