  "review": "This flagging tape is a solid choice for marking boundaries and hazardous areas. The vibrant green color makes it highly visible, and the durable woven plastic material ensures it can withstand various outdoor conditions. It\u2019s easy to use and doesn\u2019t stick to itself, which is a plus. However, I\u2019ve read that it doesn\u2019t perform well in windy conditions, which is a minor drawback. Overall, it\u2019s a good value for the price and meets my needs for marking and safety."
