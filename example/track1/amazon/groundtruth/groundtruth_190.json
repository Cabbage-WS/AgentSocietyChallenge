  "review": "The RICH-OPTO 3D Printer Resin is a mixed bag. On the positive side, it's cost-effective and has a low odor, which is a significant plus. However, the inconsistent prints and difficulty in cleaning are frustrating. The resin also seems to be more brittle in certain colors, which is a dealbreaker for me. While it has some good features, the reliability and quality issues make it a bit of a gamble."
