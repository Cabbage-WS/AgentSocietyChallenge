  "review": "These Vintage Forge Gold Top Hat Bell Knobs are a solid choice for anyone looking to upgrade their Gibson Les Paul. The fit and finish are excellent, and they look and feel just like the original knobs. The embossed numbers add a nice touch, and the packaging is well done. However, I did notice a slight gap between the bottom of the knob and the guitar body, which could be a minor issue for some. Overall, they are a great value and a worthwhile upgrade."
