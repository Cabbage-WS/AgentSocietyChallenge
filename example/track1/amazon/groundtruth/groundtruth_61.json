  "review": "The IKN Jazz Bass Pickguard fits perfectly on my standard Fender Jazz Bass. It's made of quality PVC material and has a sleek 3-ply cream finish that matches my bass's aesthetics. The installation was straightforward, and the protective films on the front surface ensured that it remained scratch-free until I was ready to install it."
