  "review": "The WBD WEIBIDA casters are a solid choice for adding mobility to heavy furniture and workbenches. The dual locking mechanism is very useful for keeping things in place when needed, and the polyurethane wheels roll smoothly and quietly. While they are a bit pricey, the durability and capacity they offer make them worth the investment."
