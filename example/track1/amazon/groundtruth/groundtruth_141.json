  "review": "I was pleasantly surprised by these guitar wall hangers. They are easy to install, and the adjustable arms fit my instruments perfectly, from guitars to ukuleles. The durable rubber coating keeps my instruments safe, and the black finish adds a sleek touch to my wall. Despite the low price, they feel sturdy and secure. Highly recommend for anyone looking to display and organize their musical instruments."
