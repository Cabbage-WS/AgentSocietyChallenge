  "review": "This Geiger Counter is a solid investment for anyone interested in detecting radiation. The device is well-built and feels durable, which is important for a piece of equipment that might be used in various environments. The user interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy to use without a steep learning curve. The bright display and audible clicks are particularly useful for real-time detection. However, there are a few minor issues. The device sleeps for 8 minutes before giving a reading, which can be frustrating, and the instructions are a bit lacking. Despite these small drawbacks, it's a good value for the price and performs its primary function well."
