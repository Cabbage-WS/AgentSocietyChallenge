  "review": "While X3 Reunion offers a rich and detailed space simulation with engaging missions and a complex economy, it falls short in several areas that are important to me. The game's open-ended gameplay and customizable ships are appealing, but the technical issues and steep learning curve are significant drawbacks. The Starforce copy protection system is particularly frustrating and has the potential to cause system issues. Despite the game's potential, these problems make it a less satisfying experience overall."
