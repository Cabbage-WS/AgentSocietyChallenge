  "review": "I'm a big fan of classic games, and the Doom Collector's Edition is a fantastic package that brings back the nostalgia of the original trilogy. The games run smoothly on modern systems, especially with the use of GZDoom, which enhances the experience. However, I do wish it was more compatible with older systems like Windows XP, as some users have reported issues. Despite this, the collection is a great value and a must-have for any fan of retro gaming."
