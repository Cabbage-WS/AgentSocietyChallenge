  "review": "This collector's edition of the Doom trilogy is an absolute must-have for any fan of the series or retro gaming enthusiasts. The games are still as intense and thrilling as they were when they first came out, and the collector's edition adds a nice touch of nostalgia and value. Highly recommended!"
