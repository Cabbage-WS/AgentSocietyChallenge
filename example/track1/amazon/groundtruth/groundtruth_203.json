  "review": "The Retro Bit N64 controller is a decent alternative for those looking to replace their old N64 controllers. It has a solid build and the added features like the slow motion and auto-fire are nice touches. However, the button response and overall feel are not as smooth as the original, which might be noticeable for purists."
