  "review": "\"WWF RAW for the Sega Genesis brings back a lot of nostalgia, and it\u2019s great to see it still functions well after all these years. The gameplay is as engaging as I remember, and it\u2019s fun to relive those classic matches. However, the controller feels a bit clunky compared to the Super NES version, and the sound quality could be better. Despite these minor issues, it\u2019s a solid addition to any retro gaming collection.\""
