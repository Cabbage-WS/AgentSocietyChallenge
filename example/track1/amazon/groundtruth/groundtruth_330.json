  "review": "The 4 Oz AMBER Boston Round Glass Bottles with Droppers are a mixed bag. On the positive side, the bottles themselves are sturdy and well-made, which is important for storing essential oils or other liquids. However, the droppers are a significant letdown. Many of them arrived broken, and those that weren't broken were difficult to use. The packaging could also be improved, as some bottles showed signs of scuffing. While the bottles themselves are good, the issues with the droppers and packaging detract from the overall experience. I'd recommend this product with caution, especially if the droppers are crucial for your needs."
