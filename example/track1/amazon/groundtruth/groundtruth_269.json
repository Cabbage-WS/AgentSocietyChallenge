  "review": "I was quite impressed with the MITREAPEL Super CA Glue and its activator spray. The glue bonds materials quickly and securely, which is perfect for my various crafting and building projects. The activator spray is a handy addition that speeds up the curing process, making it very convenient. However, I did find the bottle design a bit problematic as it tends to glue itself shut, leading to some waste. Despite this minor issue, the product is effective, easy to use, and offers good value for the price."
