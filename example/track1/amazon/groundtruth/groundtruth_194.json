  "review": "I was really hoping this product would align with my usual high standards, but unfortunately, it falls short in nearly every aspect. The fit is poor, and the decal started peeling off after just a few uses. The installation process was frustrating and time-consuming, and it even covers the speaker holes, reducing sound quality. This product just doesn't meet my expectations for quality and durability, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
