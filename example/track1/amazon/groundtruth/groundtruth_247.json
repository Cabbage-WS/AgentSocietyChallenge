  "review": "\"The Last Express\" is a fascinating blend of adventure and historical intrigue, set on the luxurious Orient Express just before the outbreak of World War I. The game's detailed and immersive environment, coupled with top-notch voice acting and complex character interactions, makes it a standout title. While the real-time gameplay and the unique art style add to the game's charm, the jerky animations and occasionally frustrating action sequences detract from the experience. Despite these minor issues, the game's strong narrative and engaging story make it a must-play for fans of adventure games and historical simulations. The overall experience aligns well with my preference for detailed and dynamic game environments, but the technical shortcomings prevent it from being a perfect 5.0."
