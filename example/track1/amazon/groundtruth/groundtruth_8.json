  "review": "The KLIM Lightning Wireless Keyboard is a solid option for its price point, offering a mechanical feel and a durable metal frame. However, the backlighting is disappointingly dim, making it difficult to see the keys in low light. The need to use two USB ports for charging and the wireless dongle is also a hassle. While the build quality is good and it offers a comfortable typing experience, the key action is somewhat cushioned and produces a noticeable clicking sound. Overall, it's a decent keyboard, but it falls short in a few key areas that I value, such as brightness and ease of use."
