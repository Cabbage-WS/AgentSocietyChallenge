  "review": "I purchased Skullgirls 2nd Encore for both my PS Vita and PS4, and I must say, it's an absolute gem. The hand-drawn characters are beautifully detailed, and the gameplay is both challenging and rewarding. The Variable Tag Battle system adds a lot of depth, making it enjoyable for both casual and competitive play."
