  "review": "The Ingles Adjustable Folding Cello/Bass Stand is a solid choice for keeping your instrument safe and ready to play. The fold-down safety bar and padded contact points provide a secure and protective setup, and the stand is easy to adjust for different instrument sizes. However, it's a bit on the pricey side, which might be a consideration for budget-conscious musicians."
