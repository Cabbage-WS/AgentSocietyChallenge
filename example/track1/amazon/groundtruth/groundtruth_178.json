  "review": "\"Nights Into Dreams is a visually stunning and innovative game that has stood the test of time, which is a testament to its unique gameplay and strong emotional impact. However, the price point of $203.50 is quite steep, especially for a discontinued game. The 3D controller is a nice touch, enhancing the gameplay, but the sensitive controls can be a bit haphazard. While the game is a gem for Sega Saturn enthusiasts, the high cost and some control issues make it a tough sell, and I feel it could be a bit more affordable given its age and availability.\""
