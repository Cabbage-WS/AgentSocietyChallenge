  "review": "I recently purchased the Sanuke Wire Lugs, and I must say I'm quite satisfied with the quality and functionality of these ring terminal connectors. The copper lugs are well-made and provide excellent conductivity, which is crucial for my electrical projects. The heat shrink tubing, although a bit stiff, offers a secure and weather-resistant seal, which is a big plus. The terminals were easy to install, and the flared ends made it simple to insert the wires. At $8.99 for a set of 6, the price is very reasonable, making this a great value for money. While a few users mentioned sizing issues, I found the lugs to fit my needs perfectly. Overall, this product meets my expectations and is a solid choice for anyone looking for reliable and durable electrical connectors."
