  "review": "The Behringer DD400 Digital Delay Pedal offers a solid range of delay effects with its 7 modes and 1.3-second delay time, making it a versatile addition to any setup. However, the build quality feels a bit on the cheaper side, and the controls can be a bit finicky at times. It\u2019s a decent option for those on a budget looking for a range of delay options, but it may not stand up to the wear and tear of frequent use."
