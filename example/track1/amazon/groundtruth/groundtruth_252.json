  "review": "The HICTOP Resin Magnetic Flexible Steel Plate is a mixed bag. On the positive side, it makes print removal much easier and the build quality is solid. The included two plates are a nice touch, adding value. However, the magnet's adhesive fails after a few prints, which is a significant drawback. Additionally, resin build-up between the magnet and the plate can be a nuisance. While it improves the printing process, the durability issues and additional cleaning required prevent me from giving it a higher rating."
