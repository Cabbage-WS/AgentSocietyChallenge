  "review": "I am very impressed with the Allkeen 3.2\" Stainless Steel Eye Screws. The 304 stainless steel construction ensures they are highly durable and resistant to rust, making them perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. The bronze finish is attractive and blends well with wood, adding to the overall aesthetic appeal. The included installation tool made the process easy, and the hooks hold a significant amount of weight, up to 200 pounds. This product is a great value for the quality and quantity provided. I highly recommend it."
