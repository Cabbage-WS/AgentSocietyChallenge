  "review": "The RICH-OPTO 3D printer resin is a solid choice for those looking for a water washable, low odor option. It prints quickly and with high accuracy, making it a great addition to my 3D printing setup. However, I did find that it required a bit more tweaking to get perfect prints, but overall, it\u2019s a good product for the price."
