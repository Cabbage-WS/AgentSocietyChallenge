  "review": "The N64 Retro Bit Controller is a mixed bag. While it's affordable and has a decent build quality, the overly sensitive joystick and inconsistent performance are major downsides. The buttons are responsive, but the cheap materials and slippery finish make it uncomfortable to use for extended periods. The \"slow-mo\" feature is essentially useless, and the controller's short lifespan is a significant issue. Given my preference for high-quality, durable gaming accessories, this product falls short of my expectations."
