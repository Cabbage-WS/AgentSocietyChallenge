  "review": "The TONOR USB Gaming Microphone is a solid choice for those looking to improve their audio setup without breaking the bank. The build quality is decent, and the included accessories (stand, shock mount, pop filter) are useful and well-made. The sound quality is clear and professional, making it great for streaming, podcasting, and gaming. However, I did experience some buzzing noises and intermittent connectivity issues, which can be frustrating. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall value and ease of use make this a worthwhile purchase."
