The tape is not as thick as some other brands, but it\u2019s durable and easy to use. The price for four rolls is a great value, and the small size makes it convenient to store. However, I did find it a bit tricky to start wrapping around the threads, which is a minor inconvenience. Overall, it\u2019s a reliable product that meets my needs."
