The build quality is solid, and it looks great with the RGB lighting, which adds a cool aesthetic to my desk. The power strip and USB ports are convenient, especially for charging devices and keeping the desk organized. However, I found the touch button for the LEDs to be overly sensitive, and the USB ports are not ideally placed. Despite these minor issues, it's a functional and appealing accessory that meets my needs."
