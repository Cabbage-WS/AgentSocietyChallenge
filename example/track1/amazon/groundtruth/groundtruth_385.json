  "review": "The SOMIC Gaming Headset has some great features, like the 7.1 virtual surround sound and the comfortable, lightweight design, which make it ideal for long gaming sessions. However, the build quality seems to be a bit lacking, and the mute button issue on the PS4 is a significant inconvenience. While the sound quality and microphone are impressive, the potential for the headset to become uncomfortable over time and the need to frequently reset the mute button are drawbacks. It\u2019s a decent product, but it doesn\u2019t quite meet my high standards for durability and reliability."
