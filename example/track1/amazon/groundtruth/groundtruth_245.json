  "review": "The WJSTN XLR to 1/4 TRS Stereo Adapter is a mixed bag. The 24K gold-plated connectors and flexible PVC jacket are impressive, ensuring durability and high-quality signal transmission. However, the issue of XLR housing misalignment, as noted by other users, is a significant concern. This problem could render the cable non-functional out of the box, which is a deal-breaker for me. While the price is reasonable and the build quality is generally good, the risk of quality control issues makes it a less reliable choice. I would have given it a higher rating if the manufacturer had better quality assurance."
