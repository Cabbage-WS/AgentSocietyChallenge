  "review": "I was intrigued by the wood-like appearance of this filament, and it does add a unique aesthetic to 3D prints. However, the filament is somewhat brittle, which can lead to breakage during or after printing. The texture is not as convincing as real wood, and the color can come off when scraped. While it's suitable for decorative items, it falls short in terms of durability and realism compared to my expectations. The printing performance is decent, with good bed adhesion, but the brittleness and lack of wood-like properties make it less appealing for functional parts."
