  "review": "I picked up this Simple Green Oxy Solve cleaner to tackle some stubborn stains on my deck and fence. While it did a decent job on lighter stains and was easy to apply, it fell short on more heavily soiled areas, requiring a lot of scrubbing. The concentrated formula is a plus, making it cost-effective, but it didn't perform as well as I expected for a product from a reputable brand. It's a decent cleaner, but not the standout I was hoping for."
