  "review": "The DGOL Stainless Steel SWG Sheet Metal Wire Cable Gauge is a decent tool for measuring sheet metal thickness, but it falls short when it comes to wire gauges. While the build quality is solid, and the markings are clear, the sharp edges and the lack of clear standards (SWG or AWG) for wire measurement are significant drawbacks. For a product that claims to measure both sheet metal and wire, it's disappointing that it doesn't excel in both areas. The carry pouch is a nice touch, but it doesn't make up for the functional limitations. Overall, it's a mediocre tool that might be useful for some, but it doesn't meet the high standards I expect from my tools."
