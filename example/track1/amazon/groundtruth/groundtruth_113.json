  "review": "I'm a big fan of Sonic, and this Action Pack is a great way to get a lot of classic and modern Sonic games in one purchase. The inclusion of titles like Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Sonic Generations, and Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing makes it a must-have for any Sonic enthusiast. While a couple of the games can feel a bit dated, the overall package is well worth it for the price and the nostalgia factor."
