  "review": "I was very pleased with these silica gel packs from LotFancy. The 160-pack of 2-gram desiccant packets arrived in a convenient ziplock bag, which is great for keeping the rest of the packets moisture-free. The desiccants have a high absorbing capacity, and the orange-to-green indicating feature is very useful for knowing when they need to be replaced. They are food safe and non-toxic, which is a big plus. The price is reasonable, and the wide range of uses makes them a great value. Highly recommend!"
