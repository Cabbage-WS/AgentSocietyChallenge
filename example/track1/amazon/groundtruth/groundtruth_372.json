  "review": "The Hulk game for PlayStation 2 is a mixed bag. While the core mechanic of smashing and bashing is incredibly satisfying and the cel-shaded graphics are visually appealing, the stealth levels with Bruce Banner are frustrating and repetitive. The game's short length also detracts from its replay value. However, the overall experience is still enjoyable, especially for Hulk fans. The price point is reasonable, but the game doesn't quite meet my high standards for both quality and longevity."
