  "review": "The Lisle 20400 Universal Shock Absorber Tool is a well-made and durable tool that makes the process of installing and removing shock absorbers much easier. It fits most domestic models and some Ford OEM shock nuts, which is a plus. The tool is reasonably priced and offers good value for its functionality. However, I did encounter some issues with fit on older, rusted shocks, which is a common complaint among other users. Overall, it's a useful tool that saves time and frustration, but it might not be perfect for every situation."
