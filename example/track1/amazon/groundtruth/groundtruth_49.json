  "review": "The Hamilton KB500 Classic Trumpet Stand is a solid and reliable choice for any musician. The stand is well-built, with a sturdy metal construction that ensures my trumpet stays safe and stable. The rubber bell cup provides excellent cushioning, and the lightweight design makes it easy to move around. At $28.99, it's a bit pricier than some stands, but the quality and durability are worth it. The only minor downside is the slight weight, but it's a small price to pay for a stand that will last for years. Overall, a great investment for any trumpet player."
