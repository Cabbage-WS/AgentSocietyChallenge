  "review": "I recently purchased the VictorsHome Changeover Switch and found it to be a well-made and reliable product. The build quality is solid, with a sturdy feel and a clear, easy-to-read position indicator. While the price is a bit higher than some alternatives, the premium materials and robust construction justify the cost, making it a worthwhile investment for any electrical project."
