  "review": "I recently purchased the Dimora Fenestrated Foam Dressing for a family member who requires regular wound care. The dressings are incredibly absorbent and help keep the area clean and dry, which is crucial for healing. The non-adhesive design makes it easy to change without causing additional discomfort, and the packaging is very hygienic and convenient."
