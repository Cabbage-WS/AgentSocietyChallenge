  "review": "I'm generally a fan of products that offer good value for money and high build quality, but this game, Skullgirls 2nd Encore, is a bit of a different category for me. The game's hand-drawn, anime-inspired characters and the Variable Tag Battle system are truly unique and engaging. The deep and balanced gameplay, along with the robust anti-infinite combo system, make it a standout title in the fighting game genre. However, as someone who values a strong online community, the relatively small player base on the Vita version is a bit of a letdown. Despite this, the game's overall quality and the inclusion of both PS4 and Vita versions make it a solid purchase."
