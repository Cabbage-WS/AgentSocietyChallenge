The set works fine for occasional use, and the build quality is acceptable, though it's not as durable or precise as I would expect from a professional tool. The lack of detailed instructions can be a bit frustrating for first-time users, but it still gets the job done. Overall, it's a satisfactory purchase for the occasional hobbyist, but I wouldn't recommend it for daily professional use."
