  "review": "These brown bakery boxes are a decent addition to my baking supplies. They are easy to assemble and surprisingly sturdy for paperboard, which is a plus. The size is perfect for a variety of baked goods, and they look professional enough for gifting or selling. However, they can be a bit tricky to fold, especially the lower back seam, and they are not the sturdiest boxes available. They work well for lighter items, but I wouldn't trust them with anything too heavy. Overall, they are a good value for the price, but there's room for improvement in terms of durability and ease of assembly."
