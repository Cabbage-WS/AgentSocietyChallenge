  "review": "I recently purchased these M6 x 25mm Flat Head Socket Cap Screws from MewuDecor, and I must say, they are a fantastic addition to my toolkit. The screws are made of high-quality Alloy Steel Grade 10.9, which ensures they are both durable and strong. The black oxide finish not only looks great but also provides excellent corrosion resistance, making them perfect for use in both wood and wet environments. The package includes 25 screws, which is a good quantity for various projects. The screws fit perfectly into my DIY projects, and the countersunk heads sit flush, giving a clean and professional look. The price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity, making this a great value for money. Highly recommended!"
