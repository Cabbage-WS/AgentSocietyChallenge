  "review": "This hex nut set from NINDEJIN is a solid addition to any toolbox. The assortment of sizes, especially the smaller metric nuts, is very useful for a variety of DIY projects. The plastic storage box with labeled compartments is a great touch, making it easy to find and organize the nuts. The quality is good, with a nice finish and a robust feel. However, I do wish the nuts were a bit thicker for more heavy-duty applications. Overall, it's a great value for the price and meets most of my needs."
