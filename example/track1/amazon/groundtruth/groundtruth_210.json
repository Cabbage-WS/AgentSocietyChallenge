  "review": "These Kombucha pH Test Strips are a fantastic addition to my brewing setup. They are easy to use, provide accurate and instant results, and the 100-test pack is a great value for the price. The strips are reliable and have helped me ensure that my kombucha ferments safely within the proper pH range. The compact size of the roll is a bit smaller than expected, but it\u2019s still more than sufficient for my needs. Highly recommend for anyone involved in fermentation or brewing."
