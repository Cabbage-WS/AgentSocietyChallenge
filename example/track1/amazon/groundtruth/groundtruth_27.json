While I appreciate its durable build and the fact that it's made in the USA, the initial tuning issues and the cold, uncomfortable feel of the metal body are significant drawbacks. The sound quality is decent but requires some tweaking and practice to get right. For the price, it's a reasonable purchase, but it doesn't quite meet my high standards for build quality and user experience."
