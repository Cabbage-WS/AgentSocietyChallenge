  "review": "The Blue 2124 Yeti USB Microphone in Vintage White is a visually appealing and versatile device, with multiple recording patterns and a solid build. However, the knobs feel cheap and the USB connection is problematic, leading to concerns about durability. While the sound quality is impressive, the interference issues and the microphone's size make it less ideal for my gaming setup. It's a good microphone, but it doesn't quite meet all my needs."
