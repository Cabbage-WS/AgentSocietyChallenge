  "review": "I am highly impressed with this 1/4\" 4Fl SE Carbide End Mill. As someone who frequently works with DIY and hardware, the build quality and durability of this tool are top-notch. It cuts through tough materials like aluminum and old axleshafts with ease, and the solid micrograin carbide construction ensures it holds up well over multiple projects. The fact that it fits into many routers and offers good value for money makes it an excellent addition to my toolkit. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and effective end mill."
