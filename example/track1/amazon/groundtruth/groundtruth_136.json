  "review": "I recently purchased the ProTec Liberty Mutes ML105 for my trombone and I am thoroughly impressed. The sound quality is rich and clear, and the aluminum construction feels durable and reliable. It's a great value for the price and I would definitely recommend it to any trombone player looking to enhance their sound."
