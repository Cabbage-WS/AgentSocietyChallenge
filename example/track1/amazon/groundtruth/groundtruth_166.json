  "review": "The iGaging 2-3\" Digital Electronic Outside Micrometer is a solid tool that meets my standards for precision and durability. The large, clear LCD display and the ability to switch between metric and inch measurements are very convenient. The accuracy of \u00b10.00016\" is impressive, and the carbide measuring surfaces ensure long-lasting performance. While the plastic handle feels a bit cheap, the overall build quality and value for the price are excellent. This micrometer is a great addition to any toolkit, especially for those who need reliable and precise measurements."
