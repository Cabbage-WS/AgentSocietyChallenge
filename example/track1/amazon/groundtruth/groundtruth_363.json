  "review": "This capacitor is a solid choice for anyone looking to replace an old or faulty one. The high-grade metallized polypropylene film and 60,000-hour reliability are impressive, and it worked perfectly for my needs. The installation was straightforward, even for someone with basic DIY skills. However, I did notice that the dimensions were slightly different from my old capacitor, which could be a minor issue for some. Overall, it's a reliable and cost-effective solution."
