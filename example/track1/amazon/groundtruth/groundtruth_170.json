  "review": "I recently purchased the Install Bay Diodes 1 Amp 20 Pack and was very pleased with the quality and performance. The diodes are well-made and easy to use, which is exactly what I look for in electronics. The pack of 20 is a great value for the price, and they work as advertised. While there are a few reports of issues at higher currents, my experience has been consistently positive, and I would definitely buy these again."
