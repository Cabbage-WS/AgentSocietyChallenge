  "review": "I was generally satisfied with the ProTapes Pro Duct 100 PE-Coated Cloth Economy Duct Tape. The tape is strong, sticky, and easy to tear, making it convenient for a variety of household and maintenance tasks. The black color and 60-yard length provide good value for the price. However, I noticed that the tape is a bit thinner than I expected, which might affect its durability over time. Despite this, it performed well for the tasks I needed it for, and I would consider purchasing it again."
