  "review": "I recently tried the Zep Industrial Hardwood and Laminate Floor Cleaner, and I must say it does a decent job. The formula is effective at removing stains and scuffs, and it leaves a nice shine without any harsh chemicals. It's also easy to use and dries quickly, which is a plus. However, I did notice a slight milky residue on my floors after a few uses, which required extra effort to clean. Overall, it's a solid product, but it could use some improvements in residue control. Given its price and performance, it\u2019s a good value for money."
