  "review": "The Behringer C-4 matched studio condenser microphones are a solid choice for both studio and live applications. The cardioid pickup pattern effectively reduces feedback, and the low-mass diaphragm delivers a clear, detailed sound. While they may not have the highest build quality, they offer great value for the price and are perfect for those on a budget looking for reliable recording tools."
