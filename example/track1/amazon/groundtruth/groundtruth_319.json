  "review": "The GeekShare fruit-themed thumb grips are a fun and practical addition to my Nintendo Switch controllers. They provide a comfortable and non-slip grip, which enhances the gaming experience, especially during longer play sessions. The only downside is that they can be a bit tricky to install, but once they're on, they stay securely in place."
