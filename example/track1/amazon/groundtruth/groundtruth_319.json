  "review": "I was excited to try the Retro-Bit Generations, but it fell short of my expectations. The controllers are decent but feel unresponsive and laggy, which is a deal-breaker for gaming. The emulation is poor, causing lag and frame rate issues, and the sound quality is tinny. While the price is reasonable and the game selection is varied, the overall build quality feels cheap and flimsy. It's a letdown, especially given the positive reviews for other gaming accessories I've used."
