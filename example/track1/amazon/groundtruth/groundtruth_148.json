  "review": "I enjoyed playing \"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Jungle Storm\" on PlayStation 2. The storyline and missions are engaging, and the addition of voice command adds a unique twist to the gameplay. However, the game could use some improvements in terms of enemy AI and graphics to fully enhance the experience."
