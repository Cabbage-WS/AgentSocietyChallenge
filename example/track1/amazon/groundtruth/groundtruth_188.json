  "review": "I was pleased with the Nintendo New 3DS XL Console. It arrived in excellent condition, with only minor scratches that are hardly noticeable. The console is user-friendly and the variety of games available keeps me engaged for hours. The C stick adds a nice touch for enhanced controls, and the built-in amiibo compatibility is a plus. However, the price is a bit steep for a refurbished product, which is why I can't give it a full five stars. Overall, it's a solid purchase for any Nintendo fan."
