  "review": "The Electriduct 1.937\" Flexible Desk Grommet is a practical and well-made solution for cable management. The flexible top and slit design make it easy to route cables in different directions, which is a great feature. The installation was straightforward, and it looks professional once installed. However, I found the grommet to be a bit loose in the hole, which required some additional glue to secure it properly. Despite this minor issue, the quality and functionality are solid, and the price is reasonable for what you get."
