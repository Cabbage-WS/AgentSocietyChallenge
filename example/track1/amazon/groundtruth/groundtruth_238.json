  "review": "While the ELEGOO Water Washable 3D Printer Resin offers a convenient and high-quality printing experience, it falls short in some critical areas. The water-washable feature is a significant plus, making the cleaning process much easier and more cost-effective. However, the bottle caps are a consistent issue, breaking easily and leading to leaks. This not only wastes resin but also poses a risk of contamination. The prints themselves are detailed and strong, but some users have reported brittleness with certain colors. Given my preference for high-quality and reliable products, these issues are a notable drawback. The strong odor is also a minor inconvenience, but the overall quality and ease of use make it a decent choice, albeit with room for improvement."
