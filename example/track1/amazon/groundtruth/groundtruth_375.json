  "review": "The ETOPLIGHTING 10 LED Super Bright Lamp has a few redeeming qualities, such as its brightness and the flexibility of USB or battery power. However, the gooseneck is far too floppy, making it difficult to maintain the desired angle, which is a significant issue for a product designed for precision tasks like reading music. The durability of the gooseneck is also questionable, and the lack of a carrying case is a real inconvenience for frequent users. While the price is reasonable, the product falls short in terms of build quality and usability, which are key factors for me."
