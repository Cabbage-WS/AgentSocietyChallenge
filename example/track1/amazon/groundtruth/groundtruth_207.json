  "review": "While the smseace resistor kit seemed like a good deal for the price, it fell short of expectations. The resistors did not consistently meet the advertised 1% tolerance, and the packaging was a mess, with resistors coming loose and requiring sorting. The labeling was also difficult to read, making it frustrating to use. Although some values were accurate, the overall inconsistency and poor organization detract from the value and usability of the product."
