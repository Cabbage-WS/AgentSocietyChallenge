  "review": "I was initially excited about these spray bottles, hoping they would be a reliable addition to my cleaning supplies. However, the quality is disappointing. The sprayers feel cheap and flimsy, and the nozzles are not as durable as I expected. While they work fine for light use, they are not built to last and can break easily. Given the price, I was hoping for a more robust product. I would recommend looking for a more durable option if you plan to use these frequently."
