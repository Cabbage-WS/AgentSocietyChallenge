  "review": "These nylon lock nuts are exactly what I needed for my projects. The 18-8 stainless steel construction and nylon insert provide excellent durability and prevent loosening from vibration, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of my setups. While they are a bit more specialized than my usual purchases, the quality and reliability are on par with the high standards I expect. The price is reasonable for the quality, and they work as described."
