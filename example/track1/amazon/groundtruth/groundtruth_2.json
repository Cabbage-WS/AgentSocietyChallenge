  "review": "I was quite impressed with the MG Chemicals 99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol Electronics Cleaner. It's highly effective for cleaning various surfaces, especially electronics, and the spray bottle is well-designed, making it easy to use. While it's a bit pricier than similar products, the quality and reliability justify the cost. However, I did notice that it can dry out my hands after prolonged use, which is a minor downside. Overall, it\u2019s a solid choice for anyone needing a high-quality cleaner."
