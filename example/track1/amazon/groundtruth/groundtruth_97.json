  "review": "The Durham 123-95-IND metal shell is a solid addition to my collection of home improvement tools. The prime cold rolled steel construction and durable gray powder coat finish are high-quality, and the full piano hinge and positive pull-down catch ensure the cover remains securely closed. The handle provides easy transport, and the option to use it with plastic inserts adds to its versatility. However, the internal finish issues and the weak latch are minor drawbacks that could affect long-term durability. Overall, it's a reliable and useful product."
