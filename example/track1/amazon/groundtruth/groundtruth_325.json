  "review": "These casters are a solid addition to any project that requires heavy-duty, smooth, and quiet wheels. The build quality is impressive, and they can handle a significant load without any issues. The dual locking mechanism is very effective, ensuring stability and safety. However, the locking paddles are a bit small, which can make them less convenient to use. For the price, these casters offer great value and meet most of my needs."
