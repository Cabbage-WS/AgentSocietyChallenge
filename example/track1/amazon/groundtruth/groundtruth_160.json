  "review": "The LR Baggs Violin Pickup with External Jack Mount is a high-quality and reliable product. The Superieur Despiau \"Two Tree\" maple bridge provides excellent sound quality and even string-to-string balance. While the bridge is thick and requires professional installation, the professional-grade sound and high durability make it well worth the investment. The pickup is highly feedback-resistant, making it suitable for both professional and amateur use. Overall, this product offers great value for money and performs exceptionally well."
