  "review": "The Longruner 2.4\" TFT Digital Oscilloscope Kit is a solid choice for hobbyists and beginners. It's easy to use, with a clear and vibrant display, and it comes fully assembled, which is a plus. The device is reliable for basic tasks and is a great value for its price. However, the lack of a power supply and some minor quality issues, such as a clumsy user interface, slightly detract from the overall experience. Despite these minor drawbacks, it's a useful tool for those who need a simple and affordable oscilloscope."
