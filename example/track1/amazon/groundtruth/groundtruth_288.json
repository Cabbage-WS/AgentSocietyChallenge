  "review": "The Gwikylo Glow in the Dark Tape is a mixed bag for me. On the positive side, the tape is bright and visible, making it useful for marking steps and switches. It's easy to apply and adheres well to smooth surfaces. However, the glow duration is shorter than advertised, lasting only a few hours after a 30-minute charge. Additionally, the tape doesn't stick well to textured surfaces, which is a significant drawback. While it's a decent product, it falls short of my expectations in terms of longevity and adhesion."
