  "review": "I was initially hopeful about this PS Vita charger, given its compatibility and price point, but my experience was disappointing. The power adapter is poorly constructed, and it failed to charge my Vita after just a few uses. The build quality is subpar, and I share the safety concerns expressed by other users. While the USB cable works fine, the overall product does not meet the standards of durability and reliability I expect. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially considering the potential risks."
