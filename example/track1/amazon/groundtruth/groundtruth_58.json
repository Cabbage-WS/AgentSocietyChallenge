  "review": "While \"Virtua Fighter Sega Genesis 32x\" holds historical significance and nostalgic value, it falls short in several areas that are important to me. The graphics, while impressive for its time, are outdated and occasionally glitchy, which can be frustrating. The gameplay is fast and smooth, with a good variety of characters and moves, but it doesn't offer the same level of refinement found in modern 3D fighters. The price point of $55.55 seems a bit high for a game that is more of a novelty item. Despite these drawbacks, it's still a fun experience for those who grew up with it."
