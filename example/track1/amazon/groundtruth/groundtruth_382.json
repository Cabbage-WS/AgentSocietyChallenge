  "review": "The Rockband Rubber Tip Drum Sticks - Pink Zebra are a mixed bag. On the positive side, they look great and the rubber tips do muffle the sound, which is useful for quieter play. However, the rubber tips add a noticeable weight, making them feel awkward and less natural to use. They also don't seem to add much value if you already have drum pad silencers. While they are durable, the price point seems a bit high for the functionality they offer."
