  "review": "The RockJam WeTune is a solid choice for a clip-on tuner, offering a wide range of instruments and tuning modes. The display is clear and easy to read, and it's very portable, making it perfect for on-the-go tuning. While it's not the fanciest tuner out there, it gets the job done efficiently and reliably, and at a great price."
