  "review": "The Moukey USB 3.0 Audio Interface has some appealing features, like the 48V phantom power and USB 3.0 connectivity, which make it a decent entry-level option. However, the mixed reviews and reported technical issues, such as difficulties in setup and compatibility, are concerning. While the build quality is solid, the price point seems a bit high for the performance and reliability it offers. It's a middle-of-the-road product that might serve beginners well, but it doesn't quite meet my standards for durability and ease of use."
