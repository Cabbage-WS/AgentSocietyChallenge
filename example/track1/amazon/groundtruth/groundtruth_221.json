  "review": "I was impressed with the BIQU Resin Build Plate+Magnetic Sheet. The flexible steel plate makes print removal much easier and faster, which is a significant improvement over the standard build plate. The build quality is solid, and the strong adhesion keeps the prints in place during printing. However, the installation process was a bit tricky, and the lack of clear instructions could be frustrating. Additionally, the edges of the plate are a bit sharp, which could be a safety concern. Overall, it's a useful and durable product that meets most of my needs."
