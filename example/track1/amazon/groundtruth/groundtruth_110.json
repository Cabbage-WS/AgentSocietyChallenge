  "review": "I was quite impressed with the Stagg KXS-A35 BK X Style Keyboard Stand. The stand is solidly built and provides excellent stability, which is crucial for keyboard performance. The ease of height adjustment and the safety locking mechanism are great features that ensure a comfortable playing position. The black finish looks professional and sleek. However, I did notice that the rubber caps on the top tubes don't provide as much friction as I would like, causing my keyboard to slide slightly. Despite this minor issue, the stand offers great value for the price and meets most of my needs."
