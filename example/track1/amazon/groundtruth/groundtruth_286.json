  "review": "I was initially excited about Hotel Giant 2 due to its promise of deep customization and management features, which align with my preference for detailed and engaging games. However, the complexity and steep learning curve were a significant barrier, especially with the lack of a manual for the digital version. The absence of essential staff roles like maids and security also detracted from the experience. While the game has its merits, the technical issues and design oversights make it difficult to recommend."
