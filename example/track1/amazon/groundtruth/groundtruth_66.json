  "review": "The Gotoh Tune-o-matic Bridge is a solid upgrade for any solidbody guitar, offering high-quality construction and a near-perfect fit. The pre-notched saddles and individual intonation screws make setup a breeze, and the improved intonation and reduced buzzing are noticeable. While the middle strings were slightly higher, this minor issue didn't detract from the overall performance. The only downside is the potential for compatibility issues with some guitar models, but for the most part, this bridge delivers on its promise of enhanced playability and sound quality."
