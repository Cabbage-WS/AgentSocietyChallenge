  "review": "The Oculus Quest 2 accessory set offers a mix of useful features and some notable drawbacks. While the extended controller grips and silicone face cover provide good protection and a comfortable grip, the fit issues with additional accessories and the slipping of the face cover are significant drawbacks. The materials feel somewhat cheap, which raises concerns about long-term durability. Given my preference for high-quality, durable products, this set falls short in some areas but still offers value for its price."
