  "review": "I was hopeful that these hydraulic quick connect couplers would meet my needs, especially given the reasonable price point. However, the product fell short of expectations. The couplers did not seal properly with my 3/4 NPT adapters, causing significant leaks. This is a critical issue for a hydraulic system, and the build quality seemed subpar compared to other brands. While the initial appearance was good, the reliability and compatibility problems make it difficult to recommend. For a product that needs to be reliable, this one just doesn't cut it."
