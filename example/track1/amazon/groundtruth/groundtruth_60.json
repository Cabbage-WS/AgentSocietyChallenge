  "review": "The IKN Jazz Bass Pickguard is a solid choice for anyone looking to upgrade or replace the pickguard on their 4-string Fender Jazz Bass. The quality of the material is evident, and the cream/black/cream 3-ply design looks great. Installation was straightforward, and the included protective film ensured a smooth finish. However, I had to make minor adjustments to align the pickup holes perfectly. Overall, it's a good value for the price and enhances the aesthetic appeal of my bass."
