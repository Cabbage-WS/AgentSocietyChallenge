  "review": "The Moog Mother-32 & DFAM Two-Tier Rack Stand is a solid, well-constructed stand that does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do\u2014hold your Moog synthesizers in a neat, vertical arrangement. However, I found it to be a bit overpriced for what it is, essentially two pieces of metal and some screws. The build quality is good, and it looks great, but I was disappointed by the lack of included hardware and the potential for quality control issues, as noted by other users. While it\u2019s functional and aesthetically pleasing, it doesn\u2019t quite live up to the high expectations set by the Moog brand."
