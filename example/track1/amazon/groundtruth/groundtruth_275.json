  "review": "I was initially excited to try this PETG filament due to its affordability and the positive reviews, but my experience has been mixed. The filament prints well when the settings are dialed in, and the prints look good with clear and vibrant colors. However, I encountered some consistency issues, with occasional clogging and poor adhesion. The filament also arrived slightly damp, which caused some initial printing problems. Despite these drawbacks, the filament is still a decent option for casual printing, but I would recommend drying it before use to avoid issues."
