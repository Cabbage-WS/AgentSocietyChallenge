  "review": "The Fiodio Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a solid addition to my gaming setup, offering a blend of style and functionality that I appreciate. The build quality is robust, and the magnetic wrist rest is a thoughtful touch. The 104-key anti-ghosting feature ensures smooth gameplay, and the customizable LED lighting adds a nice immersive touch. However, the key sensitivity is a bit of an issue, with occasional accidental presses, and the space bar requires a precise center press to register. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall value and performance make it a worthy purchase."
