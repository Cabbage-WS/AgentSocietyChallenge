  "review": "The VictorsHome Changeover Switch is a well-built and robust product that delivers on its promises. The quality of the materials, especially the flame-retardant PC and premium copper parts, is evident, and it provides a solid, satisfying click when switching positions. Installation was straightforward, and the switch works reliably in multiple applications. However, the lack of clear English instructions and the larger-than-expected size are minor drawbacks. Despite these issues, the switch offers good value for the price and meets my needs effectively."
