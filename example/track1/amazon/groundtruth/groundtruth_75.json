  "review": "The Pyle Resophonic Acoustic Electric Guitar is a mixed bag. While it comes with a complete accessory kit and has a good price point, the build quality is not up to par. The guitar is quieter than expected and requires a professional setup to be fully functional. The sound is decent, but it's not a true dobro, which is a dealbreaker for those looking for that specific style. It's a decent option for beginners, but I'd recommend checking out other models if you're serious about the resonator sound."
