  "review": "I had high hopes for the JYE Tech 06204KP 062 LCD oscilloscope DIY kit, especially given its affordable price and the educational value it promised. However, the experience was disappointing. The instructions were minimal and confusing, making the assembly process challenging, especially for beginners. The kit's reliability was also a major issue; the display malfunctioned shortly after I finished building it. While the parts were of decent quality, the lack of customer support and the product's unreliability make it a tough sell. I would recommend looking for a more user-friendly and reliable option."
