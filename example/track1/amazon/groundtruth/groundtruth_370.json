  "review": "I appreciate the unique customization options for creating a superhero and the strategic depth of the battles in Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger vs. Darkdeath Evilman. The random generation of battle maps adds a lot of replay value. However, the price point is a bit steep for a game that is now discontinued, which is why I can't give it a full 5 stars."
