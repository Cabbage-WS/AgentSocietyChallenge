  "review": "I was pleasantly surprised by these grade 8 hex bolts. Not only do they meet my high standards for quality and durability, but they also came with locking nuts and flat washers, which was a nice bonus. The yellow zinc finish looks great and should provide good rust resistance. These bolts are exactly what I needed for my project, and the price is reasonable for the quality. Highly recommend!"
