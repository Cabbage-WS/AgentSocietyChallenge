  "review": "These CMS Magnetics Disc Neodymium Magnets are truly exceptional. As someone who values quality and reliability, I was impressed by their strength and versatility. They are perfect for various home and hobby projects, and the triple plating ensures they remain corrosion-resistant. The magnets are easy to handle, and the teflon separators make them even more user-friendly. While they require careful handling due to their strength, this is a minor concern given their overall performance and value. Highly recommended!"
