  "review": "The Pro-LifT T-9456 Grey Scissor Jack is a solid and reliable tool, especially for its intended use in automotive maintenance and emergency situations. The extra-wide base provides excellent stability, and the compact size and light weight make it easy to store and carry. However, the lifting capacity is significantly reduced when the jack is not fully extended, which could be a limitation for heavier vehicles. Additionally, the short crank handle can be challenging to use, and the feet bending under heavy load is a potential safety concern. Despite these drawbacks, it meets the basic needs and is a good value for the price."
