  "review": "The Eyourlife 8PCS 18 X 3W LED Stage Light is a mixed bag. While the lights are very bright and provide excellent color options, which is great for stage lighting and parties, the setup process was more complicated than expected. The DMX configuration was particularly challenging, and the instructions were not very clear, which made it difficult to get everything working smoothly. Additionally, there were some inconsistencies in the quality of the components, especially the power cords. Despite these issues, the price is reasonable, and the lights do a good job once set up, but the initial frustration and potential durability concerns make it hard to give a higher rating."
