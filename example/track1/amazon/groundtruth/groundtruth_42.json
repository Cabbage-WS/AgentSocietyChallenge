  "review": "The Medeli DD305 Electronic Drum Pad is a decent option for beginners, offering a good range of features at a reasonable price. However, the build quality and responsiveness of the pads and pedals are a bit lacking, which can be frustrating for more serious practice. While it's portable and suitable for practice on the go, the limited sensitivity and durability are issues that might not align well with my preferences for durable and high-quality gaming accessories. It's a solid choice for novices, but it falls short for those looking for a more robust and responsive drumming experience."
