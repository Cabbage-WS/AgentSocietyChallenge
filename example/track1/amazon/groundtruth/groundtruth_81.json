The ability to charge two Joy-Cons simultaneously with a single USB-C cable is a game changer. The build quality is sturdy and well-made, and it works seamlessly with my Joy-Con cases. The only minor drawback is the lack of visual charging indicators, but overall, this grip is a must-have for any Nintendo Switch owner."
