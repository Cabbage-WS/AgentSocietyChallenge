  "review": "These mini wire brushes are a fantastic addition to my cleaning toolkit. The brass bristles are strong and durable, making it easy to clean rust and detail in hard-to-reach areas without causing any damage. The comfortable, non-slip handles and the convenient storage hole make them a pleasure to use and store."
