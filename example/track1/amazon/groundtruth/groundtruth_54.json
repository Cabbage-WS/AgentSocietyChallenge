  "review": "I was initially hopeful that the Getaria Guitar Pedal Power Supply would meet my needs, but it fell short in several key areas. While the quiet operation and multiple output options are commendable, the noise issues with the 12V and 18V outputs are a significant drawback. Additionally, the perceived fragility of the build quality does not instill confidence in its long-term reliability. Given the price, I expected a more robust and trouble-free product."
