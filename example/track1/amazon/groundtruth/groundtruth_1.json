  "review": "These SwiftGrip Disposable Nitrile Exam Gloves are a solid choice for a variety of tasks, from food prep to household cleaning. The gloves are comfortable, fit well, and provide reliable protection. While they are a bit thinner than I expected, they are surprisingly durable and offer good tactile sensitivity. The price is a bit higher than I'd like for a 50-count box, but the quality and versatility make them a decent value. I would recommend these gloves for anyone looking for a reliable, latex-free option."
