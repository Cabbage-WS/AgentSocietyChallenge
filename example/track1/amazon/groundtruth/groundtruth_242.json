  "review": "I recently purchased the Nady PEM-02 Wireless Professional In-Ear Monitor System and have been quite impressed. The sound quality is clear and the range is impressive, allowing me to move around freely without losing the signal. The only downside is that the earbuds, while comfortable, do not provide the best fit for my ears, but the 3.5mm jack allows for easy replacement with a preferred pair."
