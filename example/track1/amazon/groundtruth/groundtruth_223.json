  "review": "I recently used this Simple Green Oxy Solve cleaner on my deck and was quite impressed with how well it lifted away grime and stains. The product is easy to use with a pressure washer and covers a large area, making it a great value for the price. While it's not scented, which some might prefer, it does the job effectively without harsh chemicals."
