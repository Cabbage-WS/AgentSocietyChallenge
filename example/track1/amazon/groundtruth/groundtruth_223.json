  "review": "The Game Boy Advance Light Magnifier seemed like a promising accessory for enhancing visibility, especially in low-light conditions. However, upon receiving it, I found the assembly to be poor, with parts misaligned and the lighting inconsistent. The magnifier also came with scratches, which significantly impacted the viewing experience. While it did make the screen clearer, the issues with assembly and durability make it a subpar product. The price of $24.99 feels too high for something with such quality issues, and I would recommend looking for a more reliable alternative."
