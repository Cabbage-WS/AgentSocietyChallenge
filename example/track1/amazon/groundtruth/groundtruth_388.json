  "review": "The AULA SC200 Bluetooth Mouse is a mixed bag. On the positive side, the Bluetooth 5.0 technology ensures a stable connection, and the rechargeable battery is a significant plus. The mouse is also comfortable to use and has a sleek design. However, the build quality feels cheap, and the sharp edges can be uncomfortable during extended use. Additionally, the lack of an English manual makes it challenging to fully utilize all the features. While it meets most of my needs, it falls short in terms of durability and user-friendliness."
