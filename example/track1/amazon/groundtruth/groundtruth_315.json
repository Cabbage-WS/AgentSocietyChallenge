  "review": "The dbest products Stair Climber Trolley Dolly is a solid investment for anyone living in an apartment or condo. Its 6-wheel design makes it incredibly easy to navigate stairs, curbs, and uneven terrain, which is a significant plus. The cart is durable and feels well-constructed, capable of handling a decent load. The collapsible design and multiple storage compartments are convenient, making it easy to store and use for various tasks. While the price is a bit steep, the versatility and ease of use make it a worthwhile purchase. However, I wish the weight capacity was a bit higher, as some users have noted issues with heavier loads. Overall, it's a great tool that meets most of my needs."
