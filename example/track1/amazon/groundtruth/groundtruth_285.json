  "review": "I found the DAP Silicone Sealant to be a solid choice for quick and easy sealing jobs. The product is easy to apply and provides a waterproof seal, which is essential for both indoor and outdoor use. However, I did notice that the adhesion is not as strong as I would have liked, as one user reported peeling issues. For the price, it\u2019s a decent option, but I would recommend testing a small area first to ensure it meets your needs. Overall, it\u2019s a reliable product, but with room for improvement in terms of adhesion."
