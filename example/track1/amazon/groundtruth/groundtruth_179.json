  "review": "I was excited to try \"Batman Forever\" on my Sega Genesis, but I was disappointed. The game's graphics are good and it has a nostalgic feel, but the controls are unresponsive and frustrating. The gameplay is clunky and doesn't capture the essence of Batman. It's not worth the price, especially with better alternatives available. If you're a die-hard Batman fan, you might find some value in it, but I wouldn't recommend it for casual gamers."
