  "review": "I was initially excited about the Pyle Pro PWMA230 PA System due to its portability and battery-powered functionality, which seemed ideal for small events and outdoor use. However, the build quality is a major letdown. The wireless microphone has a limited range and often disconnects, and the jacks are unreliable. The sound quality is decent but not as robust as advertised. Given my past experiences with durability issues in gaming accessories, I am particularly disappointed with the poor build quality of this PA system. It falls short of my expectations and feels more like a budget product with significant flaws."
