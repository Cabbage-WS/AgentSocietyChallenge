  "review": "The Audio-Technica ATH-M20 headphones are quite comfortable and provide good sound quality for the price. They are sturdy and the closed-back design helps block out external noise, which is great for focused listening. While not the best in their class, they are a solid choice for anyone looking for reliable studio monitors."
