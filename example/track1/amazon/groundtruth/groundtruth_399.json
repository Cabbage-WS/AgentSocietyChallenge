  "review": "I am very pleased with the Raxxess UNS1 Vented Universal Tray Shelf. The build quality is excellent, and it is sturdy enough to hold my equipment securely. The ventilation holes are a great feature for promoting airflow, and the design allows for easy installation and mounting of non-rack and half-rack components. At this price point, it offers great value for the quality and functionality. Highly recommend!"
