  "review": "I picked up \"Super Bomberman R - Xbox One Shiny Edition\" and was initially drawn to it by the nostalgic appeal and the promise of fun local multiplayer. While the game delivers on the multiplayer front, making it a great choice for family game nights, the story mode is a letdown. It feels repetitive and lacks depth, and the camera angles can be frustrating. The online mode is also disappointing due to the lack of players and lag issues. However, at $18.99, it's a decent value for those primarily interested in local play."
