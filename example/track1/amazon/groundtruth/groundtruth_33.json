  "review": "The Dreamtop 9 Pcs Guitar Radius Gauge set is a useful and affordable tool for any guitarist or luthier. The gauges are accurate and cover a wide range of common radii, making them perfect for setting up guitars and basses. However, the sharp edges are a concern, as they could potentially damage instruments if not handled carefully. The build quality is decent but could be improved for a more durable feel. Overall, it\u2019s a solid investment for the price, but some minor adjustments would make it a perfect tool."
