  "review": "The Nilight crimp terminal kit is a solid addition to my toolbox, offering a variety of sizes for different wiring needs. The high-quality nylon caps and tin-plated copper ferrules ensure reliable connections, and the translucent tubing allows for easy visual inspection. While the single-use nature and occasional quality issues with some caps breaking off are minor drawbacks, the overall value and ease of use make this a worthwhile purchase. Highly recommended for DIY projects and repairs."
