  "review": "The VR Cover for the Oculus Rift S is a solid investment for anyone looking to enhance their VR experience. The cotton covers are comfortable and do a great job of absorbing sweat, which is especially useful during longer gaming sessions. The fact that they come in a pack of two and are machine washable is a significant plus for hygiene and convenience. However, I did experience some minor fit issues where the cover was slightly misaligned, which could be a bit uncomfortable. Despite this, the overall value and quality of the product make it a worthwhile purchase."
