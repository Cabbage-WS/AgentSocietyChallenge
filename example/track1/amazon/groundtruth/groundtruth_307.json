  "review": "I received the 12PCS Mini Wire Brushes and found them to be a mixed bag. On the positive side, they are reasonably priced and the variety of brass and stainless steel brushes is useful for different cleaning tasks. The handles are comfortable to hold, and the size is perfect for detailed work. However, the build quality is a bit lacking. The handles flex under pressure, and the bristles bend easily, especially when used for more robust cleaning. While they are good for light to medium tasks, they might not last long in more demanding situations. Overall, they are decent for the price but fall short of my expectations for durability and robustness."
