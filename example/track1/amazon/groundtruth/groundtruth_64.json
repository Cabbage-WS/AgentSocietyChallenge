  "review": "The Xotic EP Booster Mini EQ Effect Pedal is a solid choice for guitarists looking to add a bit of sparkle and definition to their sound. The discrete FET preamp design and the option to boost bass or brighten the tone via internal switches are great features. While it's a bit pricey, the quality and versatility make it worth the investment for those who want to refine their guitar tone."
