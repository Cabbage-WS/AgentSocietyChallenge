  "review": "The Xotic EP Booster Mini EQ Effect Pedal is a solid investment for guitar enthusiasts. Its discrete FET preamp design and up to +20db of gain offer a noticeable boost in sound quality, making it warmer and more musical. The build quality is robust, and the one-knob design is user-friendly. However, the effect can be subtle, and adjusting the internal dip switches requires opening the pedal, which is a minor inconvenience. Overall, it's a reliable and versatile addition to any setup."
