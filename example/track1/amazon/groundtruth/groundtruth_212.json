  "review": "The Vaorwne UHF Guitar System is a mixed bag. While it's easy to set up and use, the range is severely limited, often breaking up or cutting out at distances over 3 feet, which is a major disappointment for a wireless system. The sound quality is also marred by a persistent whooshing noise, making it unsuitable for professional use. The battery life is decent for home practice, but the inconsistent performance and poor user manual make it a frustrating experience overall. This product falls short of my expectations for durability and sound quality, and I can't recommend it for anything more than a basic, at-home backup."
