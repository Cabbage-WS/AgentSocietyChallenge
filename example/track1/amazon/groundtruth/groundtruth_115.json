  "review": "The Touchless Paper Towel Dispenser by Oasis Creations is a mixed bag. While it's easy to install and holds a decent amount of paper towels, the build quality feels a bit flimsy, and I had some trouble closing the door securely. The lock feature is handy, but the overall durability doesn't quite meet my expectations for a commercial-grade product. For the price, it's a decent option, but I was hoping for something sturdier."
