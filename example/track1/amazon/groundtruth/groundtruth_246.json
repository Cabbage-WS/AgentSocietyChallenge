  "review": "I was pleasantly surprised by \"Crystalis\" for the NES. The game is a nostalgic gem that holds up remarkably well, even by today's standards. The engaging storyline, diverse weapons, and challenging gameplay are all top-notch. The cartridge arrived in good condition, with only minor wear, which is expected for a game of this age. The price point of $35.87 is fair for a classic game that offers so much replay value. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys retro gaming or is looking for a solid RPG experience."
