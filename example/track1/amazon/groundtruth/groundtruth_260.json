  "review": "The National/Spectrum Brands HHI N130-641 Zinc Bolt Hook is a solid product that meets the needs of heavy-duty applications. The zinc finish and robust construction are evident, and the hooks are well-packaged, which is important for maintaining quality during shipping. However, the lack of size options and the need to modify the product for specific projects is a minor inconvenience. Overall, it's a reliable and durable choice, but the limited size range could be improved."
