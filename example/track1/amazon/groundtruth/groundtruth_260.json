  "review": "The Rannsgeer 1/4 Inch TRS to 1/4 Inch TRS right angle cables are a solid choice for connecting my instruments and audio accessories. The build quality is good, with a flexible rubber jacket and gold-plated connectors that ensure a reliable connection. While I haven't noticed any significant improvement in sound quality over my previous cables, they are certainly a step up in terms of durability and ease of use."
