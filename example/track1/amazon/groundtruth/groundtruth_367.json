  "review": "I picked up \"Echoes of Sorrow 2\" hoping for a challenging and engaging hidden object game, but it fell a bit short of my expectations. The graphics are indeed impressive, and the puzzles are generally well-designed, which kept me interested. However, the game is quite predictable, especially in the early stages, and the hidden object scenes are too easy, which didn't provide the challenge I was looking for. Additionally, I encountered a few technical issues that were somewhat frustrating. Overall, it's a decent game, but it could use some improvements in difficulty and stability."
