  "review": "While the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Collection is a classic and highly regarded in the gaming community, I encountered some significant issues that detracted from my experience. The games are a must-have for any Star Wars fan, with deep storylines and engaging gameplay. However, the compatibility issues on newer operating systems, such as Windows 10, are frustrating. The frequent crashes and installation problems made it difficult to enjoy the games as much as I had hoped. Despite these technical hurdles, the collection is still a great value for the price, but I wish there were more updates to enhance the user experience on modern systems."
