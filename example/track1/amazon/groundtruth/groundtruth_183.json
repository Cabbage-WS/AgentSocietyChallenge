  "review": "The geiger counter is a reliable and sensitive tool for detecting radiation, making it a must-have for anyone working in or around potentially hazardous environments. Its portability and user-friendly interface are great, though I wish it had a bit more detailed user manual for first-time users. Overall, it's a solid investment for safety and peace of mind."
