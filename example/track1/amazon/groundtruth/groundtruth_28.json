  "review": "The Ingles Adjustable Folding Cello/Bass Stand (SA-22) is a solid investment for any musician. Its sturdy build and adjustability make it a reliable choice for keeping my cello safe and ready to play. The fold-down safety bar and bow holder are particularly useful, ensuring that my instrument and accessories are securely stored. However, the stand's bulkiness and some minor design issues, such as the flexibility in the neck holder, are slight drawbacks. Overall, it's a well-made product that offers good value for the price, but there's room for improvement in terms of portability and design refinement."
