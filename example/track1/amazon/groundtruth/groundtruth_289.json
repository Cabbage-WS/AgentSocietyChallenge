  "review": "I recently purchased the Gwikylo Glow in The Dark Tape and I am thoroughly impressed. The tape is easy to apply, and it glows brightly for several hours after charging in natural or artificial light. It\u2019s perfect for marking steps, doors, and other areas in my home, making it safer and more convenient, especially at night."
