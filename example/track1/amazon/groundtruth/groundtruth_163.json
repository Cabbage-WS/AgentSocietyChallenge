  "review": "I picked up Super Bomberman R - Xbox One Shiny Edition and have been thoroughly enjoying it. The story mode is fun and the addition of shiny Bomberman heroes adds a nice touch. The battle and grand prix modes are engaging, though I wish there were more online features. Overall, it's a solid addition to the Bomberman franchise."
