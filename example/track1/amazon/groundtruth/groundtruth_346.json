  "review": "I was excited to try this PLA filament, especially given the positive reviews about its value and print quality. However, I found the filament to be quite brittle, which led to frequent breakages and clogging issues. This significantly impacted my printing experience and wasted a lot of time. The color inconsistencies were also noticeable and affected the appearance of my prints. While the packaging was decent, the overall quality and consistency of the filament fell short of my expectations."
