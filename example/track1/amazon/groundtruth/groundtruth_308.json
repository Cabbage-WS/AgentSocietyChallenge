  "review": "The 8BitDo Pro 2 Wired Controller for Xbox is a mixed bag. While it offers a sturdy build and responsive controls, which I appreciate, the analog stick drift issues reported by other users are concerning. The extra back buttons and customization options are cool, but the ergonomic design might not suit everyone, especially those with larger hands. The price is reasonable, but the potential for durability issues makes it a less reliable choice for long-term use. Overall, it's a solid controller, but the stick drift problem is a dealbreaker for me."
