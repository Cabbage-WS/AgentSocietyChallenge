  "review": "The Teenitor 3mL plastic transfer pipettes and mini plastic funnels are a solid addition to any lab setup. The pipettes are well-made and durable, and the included funnels are a nice touch that adds to the overall value. The materials are of good quality, and the set is reasonably priced. While not in my usual category of electronics and gaming accessories, the build quality and functionality are on par with what I expect from high-quality products. However, I did notice that the pipettes can be a bit stiff to use, which might be a minor inconvenience for frequent users. Overall, a good purchase."
