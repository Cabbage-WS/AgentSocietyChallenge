However, the durability issues and volume sensitivity problems are significant drawbacks. Given my past experiences, I appreciate products that are reliable and perform consistently. While the microphone is a good value for the price, the inconsistency in performance and potential for cutting in and out after a few uses is a deal-breaker for me. I would recommend this product with caution, especially for critical performances or frequent use."
