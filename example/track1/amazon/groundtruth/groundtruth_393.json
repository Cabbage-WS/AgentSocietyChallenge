  "review": "The SUNLU Filament Dryer Box S2 is a solid addition to my 3D printing setup. It effectively dries filaments, which is crucial for maintaining print quality, especially with hygroscopic materials. The touch screen is intuitive, and the temperature settings are accurate. However, the lack of a fan for air circulation and the flimsy lid are minor drawbacks. Despite these issues, it\u2019s a reliable and user-friendly tool that improves my 3D printing experience."
