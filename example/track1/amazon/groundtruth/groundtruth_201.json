  "review": "The SP Bel-Art magnetic stirring bar is well-built and chemically inert, which is great for lab use. However, the size of the bar is a significant drawback for me. It's too large for my stir plate, making it unusable in my setup. The polygonal shape and pivot ring are good features, but they don't compensate for the compatibility issues. While the product is durable and of high quality, it's essentially a paperweight for my needs. I wish the product came in a smaller size or had more size options."
