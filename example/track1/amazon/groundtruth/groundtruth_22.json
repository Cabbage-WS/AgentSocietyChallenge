  "review": "The Hercules DS536B Baritone and Alto/Tenor Sax Stand is a sturdy and reliable option for storing my saxophones. The adjustable backrest and folding yoke ensure that my instrument is secure and well-supported, while the swivel legs with locking pins make it easy to set up and store. A great investment for any saxophonist looking for a quality stand."
