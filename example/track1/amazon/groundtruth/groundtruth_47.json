  "review": "This Adjustable Height Neck Caul is an excellent addition to any guitar tech's toolkit. The adjustable feet allow for a perfect fit on a wide range of guitars, and the stable hardwood construction ensures that it will last. The felt-lined surface is a great touch, protecting the neck finish without compressing like cork. The non-skid surface is also a plus, keeping the neck in place while you work on leveling frets. Overall, it's a well-designed, durable, and versatile tool that meets all my needs and more."
