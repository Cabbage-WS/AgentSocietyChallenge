  "review": "The Micro Swiss Plated Nozzle is a fantastic upgrade for my LulzBot TAZ 5. The TwinClad XT coating makes it incredibly easy to clean, and the print quality has noticeably improved with cleaner lines and better adhesion. The nozzle is durable and works seamlessly with various filaments, making it a great value for the price. Highly recommend!"
