  "review": "The Stronghero3D PETG filament is a mixed bag. On the positive side, it's a great value for the price, and the black color is consistent and vibrant. The filament prints well once properly calibrated, with good strength and minimal stringing. However, I did experience some issues with the filament diameter being slightly out of tolerance, which led to a few extrusion problems. Additionally, the filament was a bit damp upon arrival, requiring drying before use. While it's not the best filament I've used, it's still a solid option for budget-conscious users who are willing to make some adjustments."
