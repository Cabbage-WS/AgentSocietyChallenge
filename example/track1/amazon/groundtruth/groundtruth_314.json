  "review": "The BOSS Pocket GT is a handy and compact device that packs a lot of features for its size. The integration with the BOSS Tone Studio app for YouTube learning and sound shaping is a great addition for aspiring guitarists. However, the battery life could be better, and it might not offer the same depth of tone as larger, more expensive units."
