  "review": "I was initially drawn to the TopStage Universal Drum & Keyboard Throne Stool JX95 due to its lightweight and sturdy design, which seemed perfect for my setup. However, after a few weeks of use, the stool's durability and comfort issues became apparent. The seat padding is thin and hard, causing discomfort during longer practice sessions. Additionally, the tripod legs began to loosen, and the seat threading stripped, compromising the stool's stability. While the price is reasonable, the poor build quality and lack of comfort make it a subpar choice for serious musicians."
