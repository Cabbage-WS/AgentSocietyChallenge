The sound is clear and balanced, with a rich bass response that extends the high end nicely. The closed-back design ensures excellent isolation, making them perfect for use in noisy environments. The lightweight and adjustable cushioned headband provide maximum comfort, even during long listening sessions. I'm impressed with the build quality and durability, and I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a dependable and functional audio solution."
