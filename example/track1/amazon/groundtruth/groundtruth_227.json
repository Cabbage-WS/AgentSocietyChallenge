  "review": "The DROK PWM DC Stepper Motor Speed Controller is a mixed bag. On the positive side, it's well-built with an aluminum body that feels durable and a clear red LED indicator. The module's ability to control motor speed from 2% to 100% is impressive, and the anti-dust potentiometer is a nice touch. However, the lack of clear documentation and the inaccuracy in the product description (it does not support stepper motors) are significant drawbacks. The high-frequency whine is also a nuisance. Overall, it's a functional product but falls short in terms of user-friendliness and accuracy."
