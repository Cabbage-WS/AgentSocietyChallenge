  "review": "The DAddario Woodwinds Neck Saver for Alto Saxophone is a mixed bag. While it's designed to fit the contour of the neck and is made from soft, absorbent material, it falls short in several areas. The absorption is poor, and it tends to spread moisture rather than soak it up effectively. The construction feels flimsy, and the tip is prone to coming off, which is a significant concern for a product that should be durable and reliable. Given the issues with absorption and build quality, it's hard to justify the price, especially when there are better alternatives available."
