  "review": "The uxcell Refrigeration Tubing is a solid choice for DIY projects and repairs. The copper material is high quality and durable, and the tubing is easy to bend and form, which aligns well with my preference for products that are reliable and user-friendly. However, the thinness of the tubing could be a downside for more demanding applications, which is something to consider. Overall, it's a good value for the price, and I appreciate the flexibility it offers."
