  "review": "While the RK918 Wired Mechanical Keyboard has some appealing features, such as the vibrant RGB lighting and the full 108-key layout, it falls short in several key areas that I value. The build quality is not as robust as I would expect, with some keys sticking and a generally cheap feel. The non-detachable USB cable is also a minor inconvenience. Although the typing experience is smooth and quiet, the durability issues and the lack of hot-swappable switches make it less appealing for long-term use. For the price, it offers decent value, but I would recommend looking for a more durable option if you plan to use it extensively."
