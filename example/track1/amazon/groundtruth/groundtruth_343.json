  "review": "The TC Helicon Play Electric Vocal Effects Processor is a solid choice for any singing guitarist. It offers a wide range of professional vocal effects and harmonies, which are well-guided by the guitar, and the guitar effects are impressive as well. It\u2019s user-friendly and perfect for live performances, although it could benefit from a bit more versatility in the settings."
