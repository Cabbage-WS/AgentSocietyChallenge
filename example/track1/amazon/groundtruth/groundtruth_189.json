  "review": "The Nintendo New 3DS XL Console is a solid choice for gaming enthusiasts, offering enhanced controls and amiibo compatibility. While it has a slightly higher price point, the improved processing power and face tracking 3D make it worth the investment. However, the slight scratches on the unit were a bit of a letdown, but they do not affect the performance."
