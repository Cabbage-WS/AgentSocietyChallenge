The adjustability is a game-changer, allowing me to set it up at the perfect height and angle for both my guitar and ukulele. The included accessories, like the stand light and sheet music folder, are well-designed and add significant value. It\u2019s portable and easy to store, making it ideal for gigs and practice sessions. Highly recommend!"
