  "review": "I found \"Steelrising\" to be a compelling and visually stunning action-RPG, especially with its unique take on a dystopian Paris. The combat is challenging and rewarding, which I appreciate, and the customization options for Aegis are extensive, allowing for a personalized playstyle. However, the lack of a map and some technical glitches, like voice acting cutouts and PS5 hangs, were a bit frustrating. Despite these issues, the game is well worth the price and offers a lot of engaging content."
