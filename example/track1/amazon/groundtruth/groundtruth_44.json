  "review": "The pH and TDS meter combo seems like a promising tool for various testing needs, but my experience was quite disappointing. The TDS meter worked well and provided accurate readings, which is a plus. However, the pH meter was a different story. It struggled with calibration, providing inconsistent and unreliable results, which is a significant issue for me. Given my preference for high-quality and reliable products, this inconsistency is a deal-breaker. The product also arrived with missing parts, which further adds to the frustration. While the price point is reasonable, the lack of reliability and completeness means I cannot recommend this product."
