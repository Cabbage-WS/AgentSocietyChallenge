  "review": "These nozzles from Creality are a great addition to my 3D printing setup. The quality is top-notch, and they fit perfectly with my Ender 3 V2, enhancing the print quality and reliability. The precise design and rounded chamfer help prevent clogs and ensure smooth filament flow. The only minor issue is that the size isn't engraved on the nozzles, which could be a bit inconvenient. However, the overall performance and durability make this a worthwhile purchase. Highly recommend!"
