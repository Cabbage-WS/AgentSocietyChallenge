  "review": "The JBL Professional 2 Multi-Channel Passive Stereo Controller and Input/Output Switch Box is a solid addition to any home studio setup. The build quality is excellent, and the controls are precise and easy to use. The ability to switch between inputs and outputs, along with the built-in headphone amp, adds significant value. However, the slight hiss at zero volume and the potential for the volume knob to degrade over time are minor drawbacks. Overall, it meets my expectations for durability and functionality, making it a worthwhile investment."
