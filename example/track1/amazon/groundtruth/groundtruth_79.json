  "review": "The 2-Pack Classic USB Controller from IearaTTA is a mixed bag. On the positive side, the controllers offer a nostalgic feel and work well with emulators on PC and Raspberry Pi, which is a plus. However, the build quality is a bit underwhelming, with buttons and the D-pad feeling somewhat cheap and unresponsive. Additionally, there are compatibility issues with certain systems, which is a dealbreaker for me. While the price is reasonable, the overall experience doesn't quite meet my expectations for durability and performance."
