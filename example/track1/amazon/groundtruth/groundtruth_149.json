  "review": "These American Terminal E-FMR250N-100 quick disconnects are a solid choice for my automotive and home projects. The see-through nylon insulation is a nice touch, providing both safety and visibility. The connectors are easy to crimp and install, which is a big plus. While the price is reasonable, I did encounter a minor issue where the crimping didn't always secure the wire as tightly as I'd like. However, for the price, they are a good value and meet most of my needs."
