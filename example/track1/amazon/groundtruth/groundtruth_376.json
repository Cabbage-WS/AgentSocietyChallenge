  "review": "I was excited to revisit Mortal Kombat Trilogy, but the N64 version left a lot to be desired. The game is content-rich and nostalgic, but the technical limitations are a major letdown. Missing characters and stages, poor sound quality, and choppy graphics make it a subpar experience compared to the PlayStation version. The gameplay is smooth, but the technical issues and missing content significantly detract from the overall enjoyment. It's a shame, as I had high hopes for a more polished package."
