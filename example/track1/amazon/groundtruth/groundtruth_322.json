  "review": "The Fastronix 3 Pack Heavy Duty Push Button Momentary Start Switch is an excellent addition to any industrial or automotive setup. The build quality is top-notch, and the switches are incredibly durable, which is crucial for heavy-duty applications. The black neoprene cap provides great protection against dust and moisture, and the installation process is straightforward. The switches are rated for 60 amps at 12 volts, making them suitable for a wide range of uses, from tractors to generators. While some users have noted issues with the weatherproofing, the overall performance and value for the price make this product a standout choice. Highly recommend!"
