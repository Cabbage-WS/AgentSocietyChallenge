  "review": "I am thoroughly impressed with Game Builder Garage Standard for the Nintendo Switch. As a user who values high-quality, engaging, and fun products, this game delivers on all fronts. The programming lessons are well-structured and easy to follow, making it a great introduction to game development for both kids and adults. The Nodon system is intuitive and keeps the learning process enjoyable. While some users have pointed out the lack of an in-game sharing system and limited customization options, these issues do not detract from the overall positive experience. The game encourages creativity and provides a solid foundation for those interested in programming. It's a fantastic investment for anyone looking to explore game creation in a fun and educational way."
