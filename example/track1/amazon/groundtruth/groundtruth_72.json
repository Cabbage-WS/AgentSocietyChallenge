  "review": "The HORI Zelda Protector is a stylish and effective way to safeguard my Nintendo Switch. The special gold finish and Breath of the Wild design make it stand out, and it's easy to attach and remove. While it's a bit pricey, the quality and official licensing by Nintendo make it worth the investment."
