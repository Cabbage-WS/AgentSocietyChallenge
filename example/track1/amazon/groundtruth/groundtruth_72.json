The case is easy to install and provides good protection for my Switch. However, I encountered some issues with the screen protector, which scratched easily. Additionally, the grips can be a bit uncomfortable during extended gaming sessions. Despite these drawbacks, it\u2019s a solid choice for Switch owners looking for a stylish and protective case."
