The silicone material is soft and comfortable, providing a better grip during extended gaming sessions. The designs are cute and add a personal touch to the controller. Installation was a bit tricky but once in place, they stayed securely without any issues. While not as essential as some of my other tech accessories, these grips are a nice upgrade for anyone looking to enhance their gaming experience."
