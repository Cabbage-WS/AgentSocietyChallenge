  "review": "I recently picked up the Mumba TV Dock for my Nintendo Switch OLED, and it's been a solid addition to my setup. The compact design and 4K output make it a great travel companion, and the USB 3.0 port is handy for connecting accessories. While it's not as robust as the official dock, it's a reliable and affordable alternative that meets my needs for TV mode and charging."
