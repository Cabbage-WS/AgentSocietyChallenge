  "review": "The M-Audio Keystation 88ES is a solid choice for a MIDI controller, especially for its price point. The semi-weighted keys are responsive and suitable for various playing styles, and the pitch bend and modulation wheels, while not perfect, are functional. The build quality is decent, and it's lightweight, making it easy to transport. However, it lacks some advanced features that might keep me engaged for longer periods, similar to how some video games only hold my attention for a limited time. Overall, it's a good value, but there's room for improvement in terms of durability and additional features."
