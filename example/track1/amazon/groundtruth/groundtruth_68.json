  "review": "The EspoTek Labrador is a compact and versatile device that offers a lot of functionality for the price, which is a plus. However, the lack of clear documentation and the fragility of the device are significant drawbacks. While it works well for basic projects and breadboarding, the noise issues and bent pins I experienced are concerning. The open-source nature is a good selling point, but the quality control needs improvement. Overall, it's a decent tool, but not without its flaws."
