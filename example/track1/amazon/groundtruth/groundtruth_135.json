The mute significantly reduces volume, making it perfect for practice in shared spaces, and it fits snugly without causing any issues. The minimal back pressure ensures that my playing technique remains unaffected, and the slight tone distortion is a minor issue that doesn\u2019t detract from its overall effectiveness. Highly recommend for both beginners and experienced players."
