  "review": "The Karlling music stand light is a handy and versatile tool for any musician. Its clip-on design and adjustable neck make it easy to use with music stands, pianos, or desks. While it's not the brightest light available, it provides sufficient illumination and the battery operation makes it portable for performances or practice sessions on the go."
