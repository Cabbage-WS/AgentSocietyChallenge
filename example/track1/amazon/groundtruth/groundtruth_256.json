The device supports a wide range of retro games, and the TV-out feature is a nice touch. However, I did notice some issues with the screen resolution and aspect ratio, which caused some games to look a bit blurry. Additionally, the buttons could be more responsive. Despite these minor drawbacks, it's a good value for the price and a fun device for retro gaming enthusiasts."
