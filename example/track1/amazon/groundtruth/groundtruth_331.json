  "review": "While the OBSEDE Acoustic Foam Panels are affordable and easy to install, their performance is somewhat limited. The sound dampening effect is noticeable but not as effective as more expensive alternatives. The panels are compressed and require additional steps to expand fully, which can be a bit of a hassle. Despite the good value for money, the need for extra adhesives and the slightly subpar performance make me hesitant to give it a higher rating. It's a decent option for basic acoustic treatment, but it may not meet the needs of more serious setups."
