  "review": "While \"Super Mario 64 - Wii U\" is a classic and has a lot of nostalgic value, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable, and it\u2019s a must-have for any fan of the series. However, I encountered some initial issues with code activation, which were frustrating and time-consuming. I eventually got it to work, but the experience dampened my enthusiasm. Additionally, the non-returnable and non-refundable policy is a significant downside, especially if there are any problems. Overall, it's a good game, but the activation process and lack of customer support made it less than ideal."
