  "review": "While \"Captain America and The Avengers\" for the SNES has a nostalgic appeal and the ability to play as classic Marvel characters, the game falls short in several key areas that are important to me. The poor hit detection and stiff controls make the gameplay frustrating and less enjoyable. The graphics and sound are also a step down from the arcade version. However, the game still holds some charm, especially for those looking for a bit of retro fun. The two-player option is a plus, but it doesn't quite make up for the other issues. Overall, it's a mixed experience that might appeal more to die-hard fans of the original arcade game."
