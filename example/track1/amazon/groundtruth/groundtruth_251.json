  "review": "The Fiodio Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a solid choice for gamers and everyday users alike. The black switches provide a smooth and responsive typing experience, and the full 104-key anti-ghosting ensures accuracy during intense gaming sessions. The build quality is decent, and the rainbow backlighting adds a nice touch, though the wrist rest could be more comfortable for long-term use."
