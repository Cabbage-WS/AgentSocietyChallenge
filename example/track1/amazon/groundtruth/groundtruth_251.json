  "review": "The Behringer DD400 Digital Delay Pedal initially seemed like a promising addition to my setup, given its affordable price and versatile features. However, after just a few weeks of use, the build quality became a significant issue. The plastic construction feels flimsy, and the pedal started to cut out randomly during performances. While the sound quality is decent for the price, the reliability and durability are major letdowns, making it hard to recommend. If you're looking for something more reliable, consider spending a bit more on a higher-quality brand."
