  "review": "\"Super Mario Bros. 3 on the Wii U is a blast from the past, and it delivers just as much fun and nostalgia as I remember. The game's levels are varied and challenging, which keeps the gameplay engaging. The digital download process was smooth, and the ability to save progress is convenient. However, I did find some levels to be a bit short, and the lack of a more robust save system can be frustrating when you get a game over. Despite these minor issues, the game is a great value at $5 and is definitely worth it for both old and new fans of the series.\""
