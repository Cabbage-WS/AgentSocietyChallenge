  "review": "The Pandaren Pack of 8 pcs Thumb Grip Thumbstick is a mixed bag. On the positive side, the variety of sizes and designs is a nice touch, and it does enhance the grip and control, which is beneficial for longer gaming sessions. However, the caps tend to fall off easily, especially during intense gameplay, which can be frustrating. The fit is inconsistent across different controllers, and the durability leaves something to be desired. While it\u2019s a decent value for the price, the issues with staying in place and the occasional poor fit make it a product that doesn\u2019t fully meet my expectations."
