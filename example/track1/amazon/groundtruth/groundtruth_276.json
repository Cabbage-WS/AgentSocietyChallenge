  "review": "This set of GT2 timing belt idler pulleys is a must-have for anyone working with 3D printers or CNC machines. The aluminum alloy construction is robust and doesn't feel cheap, which aligns with my preference for durable and high-quality tools. The package includes 5 pulleys and a wrench, which is convenient and adds value. The pulleys work as advertised, fitting perfectly with 8mm bore and 20 teeth, and the 6mm width GT2 belt. Despite a minor concern about the soft set screws and allen wrench, the overall build quality and performance are excellent, making this a great buy at this price point. Highly recommended!"
