The 3D graphics and fluid animations really bring the fighters to life, making the combat feel dynamic and engaging. The multiple camera angles and full match replay are nice touches that enhance the overall experience. However, the controls can be a bit stiff at times, and the lack of online multiplayer is a letdown. Still, it's a solid addition to any Sega Genesis 32X collection."
