  "review": "I was pleasantly surprised by the Harmony Audio HA-KEYSTAND. As a drummer who appreciates quality and durability, this stand met all my expectations. The heavy-gauge metal construction ensures it can handle the weight of my keyboards, and the stability is excellent, even with lighter gear. The 2-tier design with adjustable heights and the 5/8\" mic mount are perfect for my setup. The only minor downside is the lack of a carrying handle, but the stand is still manageable. Overall, it's a solid investment for any musician."
