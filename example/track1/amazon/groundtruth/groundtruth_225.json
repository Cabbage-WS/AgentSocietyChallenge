  "review": "\"Rayman Legends Definitive Edition is a mixed bag for me. The gameplay is engaging and challenging, with high-quality graphics and smooth performance, which I really appreciate. However, the sloppy controls and poor handling of touchscreen mechanics from the Wii U version are quite frustrating. While it\u2019s a great value for side-scrolling platformer fans and good for entertaining guests, the control issues can really take away from the experience. I wish they had put more effort into refining the controls for the Switch port.\""
