  "review": "The Orzly White Gaming Keyboard is a mixed bag. The RGB lighting is bright and customizable, which is a plus, and the keyboard is quite comfortable for both gaming and office work. However, the build quality is a concern, with some users reporting issues with specific keys, particularly the \"C\" key, failing after a few months. While it's a good value for the price, the durability issues make it a less reliable choice compared to more expensive alternatives."
