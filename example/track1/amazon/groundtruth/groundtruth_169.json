  "review": "I was quite impressed with the AECCN 40 Grit Flap Discs. They offer great value for the price, which is a key factor for me. The discs are durable and effective, handling tough jobs like rust and paint removal with ease. The quality is solid, and the plastic center didn't pose any issues during use. While they can wear out faster on older materials with a lot of buildup, this is a minor concern given their overall performance and affordability. Highly recommend for various DIY projects."
