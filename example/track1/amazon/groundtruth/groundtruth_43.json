  "review": "I recently purchased the Aquila Super Nylgut AQ-104 Concert Ukulele Strings and was quite impressed with their quality. They have a smooth playing surface and hold tuning much better than my previous strings. While they are a bit more expensive, the improved sound and durability make them worth the investment for any serious ukulele player."
