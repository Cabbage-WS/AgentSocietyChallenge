  "review": "I was pleased with the Aquila Super Nylgut AQ-104 Concert Ukulele Strings. The natural pearl color and super-smooth playing surface make them a joy to play. They offer excellent intonation and are less stretchy than other strings, which means they stay in tune better. The only minor issue is the initial stiffness, but it settles quickly after a few uses. The price is fair for the quality and performance you get, making these strings a solid choice for both beginners and experienced players."
