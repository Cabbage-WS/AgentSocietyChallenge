  "review": "The AtGames Atari Flashback 7 Classic Console is a mixed bag. The nostalgic value and the selection of 101 built-in games are fantastic, and it's a great way to relive the classics. However, the wireless controllers are a significant letdown, with lag and poor build quality. The console itself feels a bit cheap, and some games have glitches. While it's not a complete failure, it doesn't meet my high standards for quality and performance. If you can deal with the controller issues, it might still be worth it for the nostalgia."
