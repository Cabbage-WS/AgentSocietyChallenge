  "review": "I was initially excited about the \"Retroism Return of Double Dragon\" for the Super NES, given my love for retro games and the promise of enhanced features. However, the reality fell far short of expectations. The game does not work on my original SNES, which is a deal-breaker. The build quality is poor, with a flimsy cartridge and misaligned stickers. While it does offer some new stages and moves, the overall experience is marred by compatibility issues and a lack of durability. Given the price, I expected much more."
