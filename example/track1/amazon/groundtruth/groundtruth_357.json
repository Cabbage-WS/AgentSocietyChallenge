However, I'm a bit disappointed with the price, as it seems a bit steep for a $20 gift card. Additionally, the regional restrictions mean it only works for U.S. accounts, which could be a deal-breaker for international users. While it meets its basic purpose, I wish there were more value or additional features to justify the cost."
