  "review": "While the Squier Classic Vibe 60s Custom Telecaster is a decent guitar with a good value for the price, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The build quality is generally solid, but the nato wood and Indonesian manufacturing are noticeable downgrades from what I would prefer. The sound is good, and the guitar is easy to play, but the quality control issues, such as buzzing strings and a dry fretboard, are disappointing. I appreciate the vintage-inspired design, but the setup could be better right out of the box. Overall, it's a mixed bag, and I would recommend it with some reservations."
