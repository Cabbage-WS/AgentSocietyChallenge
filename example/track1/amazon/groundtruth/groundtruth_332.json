  "review": "The OBSEDE Acoustic Foam Panels are a great addition to my home studio setup. They were easy to install with the double-sided adhesive tapes provided and have noticeably reduced echoes and improved sound clarity. The only downside is the slight smell when they first expand, but it dissipated quickly."
