  "review": "The SIMGAL Wired Mechanical Keyboard and Mouse Combo is a solid choice for those looking for a budget-friendly gaming setup. The 89-key layout is compact yet functional, and the blue switches provide a satisfying mechanical feel. The mouse is responsive, with customizable DPI settings that cater to different gaming needs. The RGB lighting and multimedia shortcuts add a nice touch, enhancing the overall gaming experience. While the mouse's sensitivity could be better and the keyboard layout is a bit truncated, the overall build quality and value for money make this a worthy purchase."
