  "review": "The BOSS Pocket GT is a compact and versatile device that offers a lot of value for its price. The sound quality and range of effects are impressive, and the integration with the BOSS Tone Studio app allows for deep customization. However, the Bluetooth connectivity issues and limited YouTube integration are significant drawbacks. The device can be finicky to set up, and the battery life is shorter than I would like. While it has potential, these issues prevent it from being a top-tier product in my book."
