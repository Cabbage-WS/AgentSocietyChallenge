  "review": "The Realth Duct Tape is a solid choice for a variety of tasks, from DIY projects to arts and crafts. The tape is strong, sticky, and comes in a handy light blue color, which adds a touch of versatility. While it's a bit stiffer than some other tapes, it still tears easily by hand and doesn't leave residue. The price is a bit steep, but the quality justifies the cost. Overall, it meets my needs and expectations for a reliable, multi-purpose duct tape."
