  "review": "I received my Bebebao Zinc Alloy Acoustic Guitar 2 in 1 Tuner Capo, and while it has some good features, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The tuner is easy to use and the display is clear, which is a plus. However, the tuning accuracy was inconsistent, especially for the higher strings, which is a significant drawback for a tuner. The clip is also a bit weak, and I had to adjust it a few times to get a secure fit. The compact size is convenient, but I wish it had a dedicated on/off button to prevent accidental changes. Overall, it's a decent product, but it could use some improvements in accuracy and build quality."
