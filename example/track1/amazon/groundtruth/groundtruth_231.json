  "review": "While the Large Warning Video Surveillance in Use Sign from Dxyizus signs is generally well-received, I found it to be a bit flimsier than expected. The material is described as aluminum, but it feels more like a thin, lightweight plastic. The UV printing is good and the sign is easy to read, which are positive aspects. However, the thinness of the sign makes it less durable, and it flaps when held by one end. The pre-drilled holes for mounting are a nice touch, but the overall build quality doesn't meet my standards for a security sign. For the price, it's a decent option, but I would have preferred a more robust build."
