  "review": "The Small Hairpin Cotter Pin Shop Assortment from IIT is a solid choice for anyone needing a variety of cotter pins. The assortment is comprehensive, covering a wide range of sizes, which is very useful for various tasks, especially in the garage and with lawn equipment. The pins themselves are well-made and durable, which aligns with my preference for quality and craftsmanship. However, the plastic storage case is a bit flimsy and could be improved. Despite this minor issue, the overall value and quality of the product make it a worthwhile purchase."
