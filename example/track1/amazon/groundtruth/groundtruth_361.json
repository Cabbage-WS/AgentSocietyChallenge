  "review": "The Alesis Vortex Keytar Controller is a visually striking and highly customizable MIDI controller that fits well with my interest in music accessories. While it offers advanced features and is easy to set up, the build quality and reliability issues, such as sticky keys and power button problems, are concerning. These issues detract from the overall user experience and make it less appealing for consistent live performances. Despite its potential, it doesn't quite meet my high standards for durability and ease of use."
