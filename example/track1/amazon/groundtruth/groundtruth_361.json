  "review": "The Alesis Vortex USB/MIDI Keytar Controller is a fun and unique addition to any music setup, offering a dynamic way to perform with its shoulder-worn design and embedded accelerometer. The build quality is solid, and it integrates seamlessly with my software instruments. However, it could benefit from more detailed documentation for beginners."
