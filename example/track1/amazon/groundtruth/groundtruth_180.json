  "review": "The Boffdock Steam Deck carrying case is a solid choice for anyone looking to protect and transport their Steam Deck and accessories. The case is well-built and provides ample space for the console, charger, and other accessories. The EVA removable holders are a nice touch, adding versatility and organization. However, the shoulder strap feels a bit flimsy compared to the overall quality of the case, and there is some concern about the fit around the joysticks. Despite these minor issues, the case is durable and offers good value for the price."
