  "review": "I recently purchased the String Action Ruler Gauge Tool by AENMIL, and I must say it's an excellent addition to my guitar maintenance kit. The tool is made of high-quality stainless steel, ensuring durability and accuracy. It's incredibly handy for quickly checking and adjusting string height, which has greatly improved the playability and sound of my instruments. The value for money is outstanding, especially considering its effectiveness. While some users have mentioned shipping delays, the tool's functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment. Highly recommended!"
