  "review": "I recently installed the Highwood HG 10.5 mm Stratocaster Telecaster Bridge Saddle, and it has exceeded my expectations. The saddles are well-made, with a sturdy and reliable build that fits my guitar perfectly. The nickel-plated finish not only looks vintage but also adds a touch of elegance. The installation was straightforward, and the included stainless steel height adjustment screws and springs make it easy to fine-tune the setup. The improved sustain and clearer note separation are noticeable, enhancing the overall sound quality. These saddles are a great upgrade for any Strat or Tele, and they address the common issue of palm injuries from exposed screw heads. Highly recommend!"
