The kit includes a good assortment of colors and sizes, which is perfect for various projects. They make quick work of wiring tasks, and the self-stripping feature is a huge time-saver. Despite a few minor durability concerns mentioned by other users, I haven't experienced any issues. Highly recommend for both beginners and experienced DIY enthusiasts."
