  "review": "I thoroughly enjoyed LEGO DC Super-Villains on PlayStation 4. The game offers a fun and creative take on the DC universe, allowing players to create their own super-villain and join forces with iconic characters. While the gameplay is enjoyable and the world is expansive, I found some areas could use more depth and variety. Overall, it's a solid addition to the LEGO games series and a great choice for fans of the genre."
