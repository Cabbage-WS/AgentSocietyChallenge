  "review": "The Voxelab Proxima 6.0 3D Printer is a solid choice for anyone looking to get into resin printing without breaking the bank. The print quality is impressive, with fine details and smooth finishes that rival more expensive models. The setup was straightforward, and the user-friendly interface makes it easy to use, even for beginners. However, I did encounter some issues with the build plate stability and the durability of the FEP film, which required frequent replacements. Additionally, the instructions could be more detailed, especially for those new to 3D printing. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall value and performance of the printer make it a worthwhile investment."
