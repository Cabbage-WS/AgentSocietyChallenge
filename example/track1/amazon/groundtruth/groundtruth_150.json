  "review": "I was quite pleased with the Fred Kelly Picks Delrin Freedom Finger Small Guitar Picks. The delrin material provides a natural and soft sound, which is a significant plus for me. The picks are comfortable and secure on my fingers, allowing for a good grip and more volume. However, I did find the sizing to be a bit tricky, and they were not as easy to put on as I had hoped. Despite this, the overall performance and sound quality make these picks a solid choice for guitarists, especially those with hand conditions."
