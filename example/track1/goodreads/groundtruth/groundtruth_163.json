  "review": "\"My Rotten Friend\" is a charming and quirky picture book that tackles the unexpected friendship between a young girl and a zombie. The illustrations are delightful and the story is both humorous and touching, making it a great read for children who are fans of slightly offbeat stories. It's a fun addition to any kid's library, especially those who enjoy a bit of the unusual in their tales."
