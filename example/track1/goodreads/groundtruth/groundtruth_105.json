  "review": "\"Archie\" is a nearly wordless picture book about a dog who becomes a fashion designer for other dogs. While the illustrations are whimsical and the concept is unique, I found the story to be a bit too simplistic and the concept of dogs owning other dogs to be confusing and off-putting. The nearly wordless format, while appreciated by some, made it difficult for me to connect with the characters and the narrative. I prefer books with more depth and meaningful themes, and \"Archie\" didn't quite hit the mark for me."
