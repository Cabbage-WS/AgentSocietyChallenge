  "review": "\"V\u00e4kivaltainen tausta\" is a compelling graphic novel that offers a deep dive into the life of Tom McKenna, a seemingly ordinary man with a dark and violent past. The story is well-paced, blending elements of crime and suspense with rich, atmospheric visuals that enhance the narrative. Despite being adapted into a film, the original graphic novel stands on its own, providing a more nuanced and detailed exploration of the character's background and the moral complexities he faces."
