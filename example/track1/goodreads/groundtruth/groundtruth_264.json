  "review": "\"Planetes 4\" offers a blend of science fiction and space exploration that aligns with my interest in futuristic settings and complex characters. However, the plot's focus on geopolitical tensions and the potential for space warfare, while intriguing, did not fully captivate me. The introduction of Baron, an extraterrestrial character, adds an element of mystery, but the pacing can be slow at times. The artwork is solid, but I found the overall narrative a bit less engaging compared to other sci-fi manga I've read. It's a decent read, but it doesn't quite hit the heights of my favorite graphic novels."
