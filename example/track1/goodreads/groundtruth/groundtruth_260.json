  "review": "\"Edgar Gets Ready for Bed\" is a delightful and engaging picture book that captures the mischievous spirit of a young raven named Edgar. The story is filled with charm and humor, making it a perfect bedtime read for young children. Edgar's antics, from refusing to eat his dinner to delaying bedtime, are relatable and endearing. The illustrations are vibrant and add to the overall appeal of the book. While it doesn't delve into deeper themes of personal growth or cultural exploration, which I typically enjoy, the book's light and positive tone, along with its strong character development, make it a solid addition to any children's library. The clever use of Edgar's famous catchphrase, 'NEVERMORE,' adds a touch of literary fun, making it a enjoyable read for both kids and adults. However, I do wish there was a bit more substance in the storyline to match the high quality of the illustrations and character. Overall, a cute and satisfying book that will likely be a hit with young readers.\""
