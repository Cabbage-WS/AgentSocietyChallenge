  "review": "\"Make Way for Dyamonde Daniel\" is a delightful and engaging read that resonates with both children and adults. The main character, Dyamonde, is spunky, confident, and relatable, making her a standout protagonist. The book's positive messages about friendship, empathy, and dealing with change are well-executed, and the diverse representation is a significant plus. While the plot is a bit thin and the book is quite short, it still manages to captivate with its upbeat tone and humor. I particularly enjoyed Dyamonde's determination to understand and befriend the seemingly grumpy Free, which adds a layer of depth to the story. This book is a great introduction to early chapter books and is sure to charm its readers.\""
