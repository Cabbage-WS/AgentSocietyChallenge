  "review": "\"5,000 km Per Second\" is a visually stunning graphic novel with a bittersweet and poignant story that resonates deeply. The watercolor illustrations are ethereal and add a layer of emotional depth to the narrative. While the story is short and somewhat disjointed, it effectively captures the essence of a long-distance relationship and the moments that define it. The characters, Piero and Lucia, are compelling, and their journey through different stages of life is both relatable and touching. Despite some minor issues with pacing, the book's unique narrative structure and emotional impact make it a memorable read."
