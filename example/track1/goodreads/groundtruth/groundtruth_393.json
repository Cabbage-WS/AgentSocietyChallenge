  "review": "\"Alphabeasts\" is a visually striking book with its unique and detailed illustrations, which are certainly a highlight. However, the rhyming text is disjointed and doesn't flow well, making it a less engaging read. The concept of animals living in a Victorian mansion is intriguing, but the execution feels odd and somewhat chaotic, which detracts from the overall experience. While the artwork is impressive, the story's lack of coherence and the disjointed narrative are significant drawbacks, especially for a book aimed at children. This book didn't quite hit the mark in terms of storytelling, which is a crucial aspect for me."
