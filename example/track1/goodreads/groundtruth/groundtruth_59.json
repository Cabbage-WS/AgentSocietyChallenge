  "review": "\"Amazing Spider-Man (1963-1998) #136\" is a fantastic addition to the series, and it aligns perfectly with what I look for in a comic. The dramatic transformation of Harry Osborn into the Green Goblin adds a significant layer of conflict and tension, making the story both engaging and emotionally compelling. The deepening of the rivalry between two former friends, and the strategic use of Peter Parker's personal relationships to create high stakes, are elements that I truly appreciate. The artwork is also top-notch, enhancing the dramatic moments and bringing the characters to life. Overall, this issue is a must-read for any Spider-Man fan.\""
