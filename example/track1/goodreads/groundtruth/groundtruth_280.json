  "review": "The Big Bratty Book of Bart Simpson is a delightful collection of comics and stories that capture the mischievous spirit of Bart. The humor is classic and nostalgic, perfect for fans of the show. It's a fun read that brings back the chaos and laughter that only Bart can create, making it a great addition to any fan's collection."
