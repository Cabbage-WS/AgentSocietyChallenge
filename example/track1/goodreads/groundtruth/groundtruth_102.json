  "review": "\"Luz Sees the Light\" is a graphic novel that touches on themes of environmental sustainability and community involvement, which are important and timely. The story follows 12-year-old Luz as she navigates the challenges of a changing world and decides to take action by creating a community garden. While the visual style and the relatable protagonist are strong points, the plot felt a bit simplistic and the environmental message was sometimes heavy-handed, which detracted from the overall narrative. The book is educational and has a positive message, but it lacks the depth and surprises I typically enjoy in my reads. It\u2019s a commendable effort, but it doesn\u2019t quite stand out among the more engaging and nuanced stories I prefer."
