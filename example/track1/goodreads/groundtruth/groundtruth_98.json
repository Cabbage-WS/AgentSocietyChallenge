  "review": "\"Punia and the King of the Sharks\" is a delightful and engaging Hawaiian folktale that resonates with my love for cultural stories and clever protagonists. The vivid illustrations complement the narrative, making it a visually appealing read. Punia's resourcefulness and the moral lessons about community and courage are well-executed, though the folktale's structure is somewhat predictable. Overall, it's a charming addition to children's literature that celebrates diversity and cleverness."
