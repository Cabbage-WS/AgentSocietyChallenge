  "review": "\"Folly\" by Nada Gordon is a fascinating blend of wit and lyricism, creating a unique poetic experience that dances between the traditional and the avant-garde. The book's playful and inventive style kept me engaged, though at times it felt a bit too experimental for my taste. Nonetheless, it's a compelling read for those interested in exploring the boundaries of contemporary poetry."
