  "review": "\"Pashmina\" is a captivating graphic novel that resonates with my love for heartfelt and visually stunning stories. The art is absolutely breathtaking, with detailed and vibrant illustrations that bring the magical world to life. The story of Priyanka's journey to understand her heritage and identity is both engaging and honest, which I deeply appreciate. While the pacing can be a bit slow at times, the cultural authenticity and feminist themes make it a standout read. I'm looking forward to exploring more of Nidhi Chanani's work."
