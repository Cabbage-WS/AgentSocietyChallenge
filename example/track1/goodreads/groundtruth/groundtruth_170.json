  "review": "\"The Ant Bully\" is a charming story that tackles the issue of bullying in a creative and engaging way. The illustrations are vivid and help bring the world of the ants to life. While the message is clear and important, the story could have benefited from a bit more depth and character development to fully resonate with its young audience."
