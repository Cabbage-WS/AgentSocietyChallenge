  "review": "\"Shoes Off, Feet Up\" by Ellen Carr is a delightful collection that resonates with my appreciation for poetry that evokes strong emotions and explores everyday life through a lens of faith and humor. The poems are well-structured and varied, touching on both light-hearted and deeper themes. Carr\u2019s use of vivid imagery and her ability to capture the essence of everyday moments make this book a refreshing and engaging read. While some poems rely heavily on rhyme, which might not be to everyone\u2019s taste, the overall collection is both uplifting and thought-provoking, making it a worthy addition to any poetry lover\u2019s shelf."
