  "review": "\"More of Milly-Molly-Mandy\" is a charming and gentle read that perfectly captures the essence of childhood. The stories are sweet and engaging, with a delightful sense of humor that resonates with both children and adults. While it doesn't have the fast-paced, visually intense narrative I usually enjoy in graphic novels, the book's nostalgic appeal and gorgeously detailed illustrations make it a heartwarming and enjoyable experience. The simple pleasures and adventures of Milly-Molly-Mandy are reminiscent of a more innocent time, and I found myself thoroughly entertained and nostalgic. A great read-aloud for young children and a delightful trip down memory lane for adults.\""
