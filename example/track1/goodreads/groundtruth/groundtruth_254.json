  "review": "\"I Hate School!\" by Honor Brown initially caught my attention with its unique premise and the protagonist's humorous and exaggerated complaints about her school. The story's twist, where Honor suddenly becomes attached to the school she once despised, is a clever way to explore the bittersweet nature of growing up. However, while the concept is engaging, the execution felt a bit simplistic and lacked the depth and cultural insights I usually enjoy in children's books. The illustrations complement the text well, but the overall narrative didn't resonate as strongly as I had hoped. It's a fun read, but it didn't quite meet my expectations for a deeply woven story."
