  "review": "\"Liefdes werk van 300 dichters uit de hele wereld\" is a beautifully curated anthology that resonated with me on many levels. The diverse selection of love poems from around the world and across different time periods is both enriching and inspiring. Each poet is represented by a single poem, which provides a broad and varied overview of styles and voices. While the pacing and eventfulness of a poetry anthology differ from a narrative-driven book, the quality and depth of the poems kept me engaged and reflecting long after I finished reading. This collection is a testament to the universal power of love and the unique ways it is expressed through different cultures and eras. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates the beauty of poetry and the complexity of human emotions.\""
