  "review": "\"Lepakkoluola\" is an anthology that aims to celebrate women from history and mythology, focusing on love between women. While the concept is intriguing and aligns with the diversity and representation I appreciate, the execution falls short of my expectations. The stories, while varied, often lack the depth and complexity I value in character development. The pacing can be uneven, and some of the narratives feel more like sketches rather than fully realized tales. Additionally, the artwork, while generally competent, does not reach the cinematic quality I enjoy in my favorite manga series. Despite its noble intentions, \"Lepakkoluola\" is a bit too light and lacks the mature, nuanced storytelling that I typically seek in my reading."
