  "review": "\"Ramadan and Id Al-Fitr\" by Dianne M. MacMillan is a concise and informative introduction to the Islamic holidays, making it a valuable resource for children and those new to the subject. The book effectively explains the significance of Ramadan and the joyous celebration of Id al-Fitr, incorporating key terms and traditions. While the content is educational and well-structured, it might lack depth for those already familiar with Islamic practices. However, it serves its purpose well as an accessible and engaging read, especially for young readers and those interested in cultural diversity. The illustrations and clear language enhance the learning experience, making it a good addition to any library focused on religious and cultural education.\""
