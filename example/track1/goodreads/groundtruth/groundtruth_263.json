  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Crows Vol. 3\" is a manga that delves into the world of delinquent high school students, a theme that has some appeal to me. The artwork is detailed and the action sequences are well-executed, which kept me engaged. However, the plot felt somewhat predictable, and the character development was not as strong as I had hoped. The pacing was a bit uneven, making it hard to fully connect with the story. While it's an entertaining read, it didn't quite live up to my expectations, leading to a more neutral rating."
