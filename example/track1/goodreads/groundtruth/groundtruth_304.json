  "review": "\"Jeremy Schmal & The Cult of Comfort\" is a slim volume of poetry that, while not my usual fare, offers a unique blend of bracing imagery and philosophical depth. The language is sharp and evocative, and the poems effectively balance harsh realities with a touch of whimsy and hope. However, as someone who typically enjoys more character-driven narratives and complex story arcs, I found the poetic format somewhat limiting in terms of character development. The book is thought-provoking and emotionally resonant, but it doesn't quite hit the same marks as the sci-fi and comic books I usually read. Still, it's a strong piece of work that challenges and inspires."
