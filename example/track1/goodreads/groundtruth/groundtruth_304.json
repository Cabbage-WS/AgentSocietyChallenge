  "review": "\"Wij Twee Samen\" is a deeply moving graphic memoir that combines poignant text with evocative visuals to explore the impact of a father's progressive aphasia on his family. Ephameron's unique collage style and the emotional depth of her narrative create a powerful and unforgettable reading experience. While some sections may be challenging due to their abstract nature, the overall message and the emotional journey are profoundly touching."
