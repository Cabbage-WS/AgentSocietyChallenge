  "review": "\"Bad Rats\" is a charming and creative story that challenges the preconceived notions of what it means to be a 'bad' rat. Josiah and his friends' artistic endeavors and their journey to teach their professor the value of creativity are both inspiring and entertaining. The accompanying CD adds an extra layer of enjoyment, making it perfect for bedtime stories or educational activities with children."
