  "review": "\"The Manor House School\" by Angela Brazil offers a glimpse into the world of early 20th-century British schoolgirls, a genre that, while not my usual go-to, has its charm. The book's sympathetic portrayal of the emotional lives and friendships of middle-class schoolgirls is a highlight, and it's clear that Brazil has a knack for capturing the ups and downs of adolescent life. However, the pacing and the somewhat dated narrative style didn't fully resonate with me, and I found myself less engaged than I hoped. Still, it's a historically interesting read, and I can appreciate its significance in the genre."
