  "review": "Paul Eluard's \"Last Love Poems\" is a profound and moving collection that captures the essence of love and loss with a surreal and lyrical touch. The bilingual edition not only enhances the accessibility of these poems but also offers a deeper appreciation of Eluard's craft. While some of the translations might not fully capture the original French nuances, the emotional depth and poetic beauty shine through."
