  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Supergirl (Carousel Books)\" is a short, straightforward read that might appeal to younger audiences, but it falls short of the deeper, more intellectually engaging narratives I typically enjoy. The book lacks the complex character development and profound themes that I value, and the plot is rather simplistic. While it might be a fun, light-hearted read for some, it did not resonate with me on a deeper level, and the limited depth of the story and characters left me feeling unfulfilled."
