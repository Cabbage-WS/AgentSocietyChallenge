  "review": "\"Seeing Things\" by Robin Klein is a well-crafted book that resonates with its portrayal of children and their experiences, which aligns with my appreciation for strong character development and emotional depth. However, the plot felt a bit underwhelming and didn't capture my interest as much as I had hoped. The clairvoyant element was intriguing but not as well-integrated into the story as it could have been. While the writing is solid and the characters are well-drawn, the pacing and plot development left something to be desired, making it a solid but not outstanding read."
