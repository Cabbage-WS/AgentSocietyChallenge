  "review": "\"Ep\u00e4varmoina aikoina\" is a compelling addition to the Valerian series, weaving a complex narrative that spans the cosmos. The story's interconnected events and the gradual unraveling of mysteries kept me engaged. Despite being a shorter read, it delivers an engaging plot and vivid imagery, making it a worthwhile read for fans of the series and those who enjoy science fiction graphic novels."
