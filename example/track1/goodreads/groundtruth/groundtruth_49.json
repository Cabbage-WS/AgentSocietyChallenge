  "review": "This book, while intriguing in its premise of anarchist kidnappers and high-stakes negotiations, did not fully resonate with my usual preferences. The story is simplistic and mysterious, with high-quality art that is both classic and appealing. However, the lack of depth in character development and the incomplete feeling of the plot left me wanting more. The absence of official English content is also a drawback, making it harder to fully engage with the narrative. It's a solid read, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of the books I typically enjoy."
