  "review": "\"Counting Colors\" is a beautifully designed and engaging picture book that teaches young children about colors, counting, and finding hidden objects. While it doesn't fit into the middle-grade fiction category I typically enjoy, it excels in its educational purpose and is highly interactive. The large format and clear illustrations make it perfect for young learners, and the durability ensures it will last through many readings. It's a solid choice for families looking to enhance their child's early learning experiences, though it may not offer the depth of character development or complex plot I often seek in my reading. Nonetheless, it's a valuable and enjoyable tool for young children."
