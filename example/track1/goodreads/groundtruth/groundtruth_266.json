  "review": "\"The Bradleys\" is a unique and quirky read that captures the essence of a dysfunctional family in a way that is both humorous and relatable. While the book's humor and satirical take on family dynamics align well with my interest in engaging and meaningful stories, I found the format to be more akin to extended comic strips, which didn't quite hit the mark for deep character development that I usually enjoy. Nonetheless, the book's ability to evoke laughter and its universal themes make it a worthwhile read, even if it doesn't fully resonate on an emotional level."
