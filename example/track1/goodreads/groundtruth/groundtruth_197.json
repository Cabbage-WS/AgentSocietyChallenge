  "review": "\"Floors\" is a delightful and imaginative middle-grade novel that captures the essence of a whimsical adventure. The Whippet Hotel, with its eccentric and creative rooms, is a setting that sparks curiosity and wonder. Leo, the maintenance man's son, is a relatable and likable protagonist, and his journey to uncover the hotel's secrets is both engaging and thrilling. The book's use of humor and quirkiness, along with its moral and educational value, aligns well with my preferences. However, I found the plot to be somewhat derivative, and the ending was a bit predictable. Despite these minor drawbacks, \"Floors\" is a fun and heartwarming read that I would recommend to young readers and adults alike."
