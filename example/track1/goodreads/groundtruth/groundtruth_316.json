  "review": "\"Do You Speak Chocolate?\" is a heartwarming and engaging story that explores themes of friendship, cultural differences, and belonging. The characters, particularly Jaz and Nadima, are well-developed and relatable, which makes their interactions and challenges feel authentic. The plot moves at a good pace, and the book does a great job of introducing important social issues in a way that is accessible to its young audience. However, while the story is well-executed, it didn't quite capture the level of suspense or originality that I typically enjoy in a book. It's a solid read, but it didn't stand out as a favorite."
