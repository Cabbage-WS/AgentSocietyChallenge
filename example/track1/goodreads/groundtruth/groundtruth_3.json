  "review": "\"Kids Draw Manga Shoujo\" is a mixed bag for me. While it offers a step-by-step guide to drawing manga shoujo, which is engaging and suitable for its intended audience, it doesn't fully resonate with my preference for stories that have strong, positive themes and deep character development. The book is more of a technical guide rather than a narrative, which is not my primary interest. However, the clear instructions and colorful illustrations make it a useful tool for those interested in manga art. It's a solid resource, but it doesn't capture the heartwarming or adventurous elements I usually seek in a book."
