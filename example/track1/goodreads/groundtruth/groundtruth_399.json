  "review": "\"Alphabeasts is a delightfully unique alphabet book that captivates with its imaginative and whimsical illustrations. Wallace Edwards' watercolor and colored pencil artwork brings a Victorian mansion to life, filled with a quirky cast of animals in unexpected settings. This book is not only educational but also a feast for the eyes, making it a wonderful addition to any child's library.\""
