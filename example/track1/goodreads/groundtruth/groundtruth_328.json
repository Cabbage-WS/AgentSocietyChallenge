  "review": "\"Billabong's Daughter\" is a charming addition to the Billabong series, blending adventure with heartfelt family dynamics. Mary-Kate's encounter with the yalla horse and the subsequent friendship with the Lintons of Billabong add a layer of excitement and warmth to the narrative. Wally's journey to uncover the truth behind his brother's death is gripping, and the evolving relationship between Wally and Norah is beautifully depicted, making this book a delightful read for those who enjoy classic Australian literature."
