  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"The Flash Archives, Vol. 1\" offers a classic superhero experience that, while not in my usual wheelhouse of children's literature and poetry, still has its charms. The dynamic artwork and engaging characters, particularly the energetic Barry Allen, make for an enjoyable read. However, the cheesy elements and dated science feel a bit out of place, which detracts from the overall experience. Despite this, the book is a fun and nostalgic dive into the Silver Age of comics, but it doesn't quite hit the same emotional notes as the books that I typically enjoy."
