  "review": "\"Glasses\" by Lane Smith is a unique and imaginative children's book that explores the world through a boy's reluctance to wear glasses. The story is light and engaging, with a touch of humor that children would likely enjoy. However, as an adult reader, I found the narrative a bit simplistic and the character development somewhat lacking. While it's a good read for its target audience, it didn't quite capture my interest as much as I had hoped. It's a solid choice for young readers who might be hesitant about wearing glasses, but it didn't resonate with me on a deeper level."
