  "review": "\"Glasses\" by Lane Smith is a delightful and humorous take on the experience of wearing glasses for the first time. The book's illustrations are vibrant and engaging, making the story come alive for young readers. It effectively addresses the common concerns of children about looking different, with a touch of whimsy that both kids and adults will enjoy."
