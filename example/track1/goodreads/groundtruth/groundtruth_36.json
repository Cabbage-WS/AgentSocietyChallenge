  "review": "\"Filsafat Untuk Pemula\" is an intriguing attempt to demystify philosophy for beginners. While I appreciate the book's intention to make complex ideas accessible through a structured 5W+1H framework and engaging comic strips, I found the execution somewhat uneven. The initial chapters are captivating, offering a gentle introduction to philosophical concepts. However, as the book progresses, the use of complex terminology without adequate explanation becomes a barrier to understanding. The visual elements, while helpful, lack the polish and detail I enjoy in well-illustrated books. Overall, it's a commendable effort that could benefit from clearer explanations and more refined illustrations to fully engage its audience.\""
