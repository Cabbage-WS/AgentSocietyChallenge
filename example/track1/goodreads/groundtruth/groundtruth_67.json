  "review": "\"Regis Loisel's graphic novel 'Peter Pan' offers a rich, dark, and mature prequel to the beloved classic, delving into the origins of the boy who never grew up. The artwork is stunning, capturing the whimsical and eerie essence of the Neverland mythos. While it may not appeal to all fans of the original, it is a fascinating and beautifully crafted exploration of Peter's early life.\""
