  "review": "\"Peter Pan\" by Regis Loisel offers a unique and captivating reimagining of the classic tale, perfectly aligning with my love for fantasy and mythology. The artwork is maliciously detailed and intriguing, blending a fairy-tale atmosphere with a harsh, realistic twist. This darker, more mature take on Peter's story maintains the charm and innocence of the original while adding a layer of depth and complexity that I found thoroughly engaging. The vivid portrayal of the Victorian era and the fantastical elements make this a standout graphic novel that resonates deeply with my preferences for rich, thought-provoking narratives."
