  "stars": 5.0,
  "review": "\"Heaven All Day\" is a beautifully crafted graphic novel that resonated with me on multiple levels. The story of a lonely factory worker and an abandoned robot intertwining their lives is both heartwarming and poignant, much like the themes I enjoy in children's literature but with a mature twist. The character development is strong, and the emotional depth and simplicity of the narrative are stunning. The book's focus on hope and personal growth, despite the challenges faced by the characters, aligns perfectly with my preferences. It's a little heartbreaking at times, but ultimately uplifting. Highly recommend."
