  "review": "\"Circles, Triangles, and Squares\" is a charming and visually engaging book that introduces young children to basic shapes through a series of black and white photographs. While it lacks text, which might be a downside for those looking for a more narrative-driven experience, the book excels in its ability to make learning about shapes interactive and fun. The photographs are beautifully composed and effectively highlight the shapes in everyday objects, encouraging children to explore their surroundings with a new perspective. However, for someone who appreciates the whimsical and fantastical elements of classic children's literature, this book might not offer the same level of imaginative storytelling. It's a solid educational tool, but it doesn't quite capture the magic and nostalgia of the books I love most."
