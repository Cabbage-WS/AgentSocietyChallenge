  "review": "\"Yes, Master\" by Michael Earl Craig is an intriguing blend of poetic and documentary styles that explore the contemporary West. While the book's humor and diverse themes, such as the author's experiences as a farrier, are engaging, I found the humor to be inconsistent, with some poems feeling forced. The book's unique perspective and vivid imagery, especially in poems like the one about receiving an anvil in the mail, are memorable. However, the lack of deeper connection and purpose in some poems left me questioning their relevance. Overall, it's an interesting read, but it didn't fully resonate with my preference for strong, inspirational messages.\""
