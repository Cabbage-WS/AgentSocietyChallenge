  "review": "\"Ultimates (2015-) #2\" didn't quite hit the mark for me. While the premise of a super team facing off against Galactus is intriguing, the execution felt heavy-handed and overly complex. The scientific elements were a bit too dense and detracted from the pacing, making it hard to stay engaged. The visuals are strong, but the story needed more balance between action and scientific exposition. It's a solid comic, but it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped."
