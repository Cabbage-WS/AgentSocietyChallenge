  "review": "\"The Star Lost\" offers a compelling and visually stunning graphic novel experience, which is a departure from my usual preference for children's literature. However, the high-quality artwork and dynamic storytelling make it a captivating read. The dual storyline, featuring both the Enterprise crew and the shuttle crew, keeps the tension high and the pacing brisk. While it's not as focused on moral lessons or educational content for children, the involvement of beloved Star Trek characters and the exciting action sequences make it a fun and engaging read for adults and older children alike."
