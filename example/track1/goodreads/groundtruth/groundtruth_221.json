  "review": "\"Felix Takes The Stage\" is an interesting blend of factual information and a fictional narrative, which I appreciated for its educational value. The characters, particularly the Deadlies family, are engaging and well-developed, making the story quite charming. However, the plot can be a bit confusing at times, which detracted from my overall enjoyment. The didactic tone was also a bit heavy, which might not appeal to all readers. Despite these issues, the book has a certain sweetness and heart that made it a worthwhile read, especially for its target audience of younger readers."
