  "review": "\"Costume\" from the Eyewitness series is a visually engaging book that introduces the history of clothing from prehistoric times to the present. The book is well-suited for young readers with its colorful images and accessible text. However, the organization jumps between chronological and thematic sections, which can be confusing. Additionally, the lack of precise time periods for the clothing and limited detailed information might not satisfy older readers or those seeking more in-depth knowledge. Despite these issues, it remains a cute and educational read, especially for those interested in a broad overview of costume history."
