  "review": "\"Daimi Bradvata\" is an absolute delight, especially for those who appreciate a blend of fantasy and children's literature. The story's unique premise of children naming themselves is both imaginative and heartwarming. The translation by Petko Bocharov is seamless, capturing the essence of the original Bulgarian text, while the illustrations by Rumen Statkov are superb, adding a visual richness that complements the narrative. The pacing is just right, and the characters are endearing, making it a joy to read. This book is a cultural treasure that resonates with both children and adults, and it exceeds my expectations in every way. Highly recommended!"
