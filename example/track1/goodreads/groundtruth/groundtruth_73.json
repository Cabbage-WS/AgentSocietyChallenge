  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Caperucita Roja\" is a classic fairy tale with a rich history, but I found this edition to be somewhat lacking in depth and originality. The inclusion of multiple versions by Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Tieck is interesting, but the overall presentation felt more educational than engaging. While the theme of transitioning from childhood to adolescence is relevant, the storytelling didn't capture my imagination as much as I had hoped. The moralizing tone of some versions, particularly Perrault's, was a bit off-putting. The book is well-intentioned, but it didn't fully resonate with me, especially compared to more modern and thought-provoking works in the dystopian and conceptual fiction genres that I typically enjoy."
