  "review": "\"Big Nate Flips Out\" is a delightful addition to the series, with its humorous and relatable portrayal of school life. Nate's antics and the friendships he navigates are both entertaining and heartwarming. The illustrations add a lot to the story, making it a fun read. While the plot can be a bit predictable and some of the humor might be a tad juvenile, it still manages to capture the essence of childhood and the importance of friendship. It's a great book for those who enjoy light-hearted, engaging stories with a touch of comedy."
