  "review": "\"The Dreamsnatcher\" is a captivating middle-grade fantasy that aligns well with my taste for engaging and humorous storytelling. The fast-paced plot, filled with magical elements and suspense, kept me hooked from start to finish. Moll, the protagonist, is a strong and relatable character, and her bond with the wildcat Gryff adds a delightful layer of humor and loyalty. The world-building is rich and imaginative, with a respectful portrayal of Romani culture that adds depth to the story. While the beginning was a bit slower, it quickly picked up and delivered a thrilling adventure. A great read for anyone who enjoys fantasy with a touch of darkness and a lot of heart.\""
