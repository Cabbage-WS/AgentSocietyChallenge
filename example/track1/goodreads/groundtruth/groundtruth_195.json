  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Roll of Thunder Gift Set\" is a compelling and historically significant series that delves into the lives of the Logan family during the Great Depression in the South. The characters are richly developed, and the narrative is both engaging and thought-provoking. While the themes of racial injustice and family resilience are powerful, the pacing can be slower at times, which might not align perfectly with my preference for more adventurous and fantastical elements. However, the depth of the characters and the important moral lessons make it a worthy read, especially for those interested in historical fiction and coming-of-age stories."
