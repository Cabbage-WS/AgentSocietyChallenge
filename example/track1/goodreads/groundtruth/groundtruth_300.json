  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Wij twee samen\" is a unique blend of autobiography and graphic novel, focusing on the author's experience with her father's progressive aphasia. While the book is visually rich and emotionally poignant, it doesn't align with my preference for fast-paced, dystopian narratives. The slow, introspective nature of the story and its realistic fiction elements made it less engaging for me. However, I appreciate the sensitivity and creativity in how the author combines text and visuals to convey a deeply personal journey. It's a well-crafted book, but not my cup of tea."
