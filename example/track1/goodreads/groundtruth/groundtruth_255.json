  "review": "\"Little Songs of the Geisha\" is a beautifully crafted book that offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Japanese geishas through their songs. The inclusion of the original Japanese text alongside the translations adds a layer of authenticity and depth. However, the book's brevity was a bit disappointing, leaving me wanting more content and deeper analysis. While the subject matter and cultural insights are intriguing, the limited scope and lack of extensive storytelling might not fully satisfy those looking for a more comprehensive exploration of the geisha lifestyle. Still, it's a worthwhile read for those interested in Japanese culture and poetry."
