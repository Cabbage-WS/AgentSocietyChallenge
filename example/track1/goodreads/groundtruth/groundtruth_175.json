  "review": "\"Curious George's Are You Curious?\" is a delightful read that perfectly captures the spirit of curiosity and mischief that I adore in children's literature. The book's playful tone and engaging illustrations make it a joy to read aloud. It resonates with the themes of self-identity and the value of being true to oneself, which are close to my heart. Just like in 'Cowboy, Ninja, Bear,' this book encourages creativity and imagination, making it a fantastic addition to any child's library. I highly recommend it for its ability to spark joy and conversation.\""
