  "review": "\"Death of Dracula\" didn't quite hit the mark for me. The book's disjointed narrative, with its abrupt shifts between old and new story arcs, made it difficult to fully engage with the plot. The characters, particularly Xarus and Janus, lacked depth and the rivalry between them felt somewhat contrived. While the concept of a vampire war is intriguing, the execution fell short, with incomplete story arcs that left me feeling unsatisfied. The art was decent, but it couldn't save the overall experience. This book didn't align well with my preference for well-paced, character-driven stories."
