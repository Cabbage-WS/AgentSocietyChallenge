  "review": "\"Billabong's Daughter\" is a delightful addition to the Billabong series, and it resonates with my love for strong, relatable characters and themes of family and friendship. The character of Wally is particularly well-developed, making his journey both engaging and emotionally satisfying. The story balances humor and serious moments, and the historical setting adds a unique flavor. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of my favorite middle-grade novels, it's a charming and enjoyable read that I would recommend to fans of the genre."
