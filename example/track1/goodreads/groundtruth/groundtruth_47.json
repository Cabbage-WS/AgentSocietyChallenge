  "review": "\"Smith\" offers a compelling and nostalgic Victorian setting that many readers, including myself, found engaging. The Dickensian style is well-executed, and the story is certainly captivating. However, while the book excels in its historical and stylistic elements, it doesn't delve deeply into the personal growth or social issues that I often look for in a book. The characters felt a bit flat and the plot, while interesting, didn't provide the depth or originality I usually enjoy. It's a good read, but it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped."
