  "review": "\"Abigail Adams\" is a well-crafted biography that resonates with my appreciation for engaging and educational children's literature. The book effectively captures the spirit of Abigail Adams, highlighting her significant contributions and the challenges she faced. While I found the narrative to be quite engaging and the character development strong, I do wish the author had included the famous 'remember the ladies' letter, as it is a pivotal moment in history. Despite this minor omission, the book remains a valuable and enjoyable read for both children and adults.\""
