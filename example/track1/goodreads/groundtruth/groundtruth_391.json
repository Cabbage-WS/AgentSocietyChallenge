  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Sesso? Fai da te!\" by Giobbe Covatta is a peculiar read, but it didn't quite hit the mark for me. The humor is hit-or-miss, with some bits landing and others falling flat. The writing style is quite casual and sometimes crass, which I found off-putting at times. The character development is minimal, and the plot, if there is one, is more of a series of anecdotes. While the book attempts to be humorous and light-hearted, it often feels more like a series of disconnected jokes. I appreciate the attempt at breaking taboos, but the execution leaves something to be desired. Not my cup of tea, but it might appeal to those who enjoy more irreverent and satirical content."
