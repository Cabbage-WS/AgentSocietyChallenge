  "review": "\"I enjoyed 'I Want to Do Yoga Too' for its gentle introduction to yoga for young children. The story of Hallie and her babysitter is endearing, and the simple instructions for the yoga poses are easy to follow. It\u2019s a fun and educational read, perfect for parents and caregivers looking to introduce yoga to their little ones.\""
