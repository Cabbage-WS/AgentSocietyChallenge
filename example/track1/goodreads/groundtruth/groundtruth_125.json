  "review": "\"Tonight on the Titanic\" is an engaging and well-handled book that resonates with its young audience. The Magic Tree House series does an excellent job of blending historical events with adventurous storytelling, making the Titanic disaster accessible and respectful for children. The characters of Jack and Annie are endearing, and their mission to help others adds a layer of heroism and urgency. While the pacing is swift, the story doesn't sacrifice depth, making it a memorable read that aligns well with my preference for books that have a meaningful impact."
