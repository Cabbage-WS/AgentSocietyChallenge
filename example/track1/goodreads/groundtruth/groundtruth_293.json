  "review": "\"Einstein Anderson Shocks His Friends\" is a light and engaging read that brings a scientific twist to a familiar formula. While the incorporation of scientific elements is a positive, the story feels derivative of the \"Encyclopedia Brown\" series, lacking the originality and depth I typically enjoy. The characters are somewhat one-dimensional, and the plot, though not entirely predictable, doesn't offer the suspense or emotional depth I crave. It's a decent book for young readers interested in science, but it doesn't quite meet my higher standards for character development and plot innovation."
