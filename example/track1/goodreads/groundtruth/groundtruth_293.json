  "review": "\"Ania ze Zotego Brzegu\" is a charming Polish translation of a beloved classic, offering a delightful insight into the life of a spirited and imaginative young girl. While the story is engaging and the characters are well-developed, the translation sometimes feels a bit clunky, which detracts slightly from the overall reading experience. Nonetheless, it's a heartwarming tale that will likely resonate with fans of the original."
