  "review": "\"Adastra in Africa\" is a visually stunning graphic novel, with Barry Windsor-Smith's artwork being a highlight. However, the story itself feels somewhat disjointed, particularly in its transition from an X-Men narrative to an eco-fantasy. The character of Adastra is intriguing but the plot lacks the depth and coherence I typically enjoy. The additional material at the end is peculiar and doesn't add much to the overall experience. While the artwork is a strong point, the storytelling falls short of my expectations for this genre."
