  "review": "While \"What Shall We Do Without Us? The Voice and Vision of Kenneth Patchen\" showcases a unique blend of poetry and visual art, it doesn't fully resonate with my usual preference for humorous and engaging children's literature. The innovative approach to combining pictures and words is intriguing and well-executed, making it a must-have for those interested in the intersection of visual and literary arts. However, as a fan of lively and interactive storytelling, I found the content a bit too serious and the collection far too short, leaving me wanting more. Despite this, the high quality of the color reproductions and the book's overall aesthetic appeal are commendable."
