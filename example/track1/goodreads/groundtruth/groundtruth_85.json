  "review": "\"Poke in the I\" is a delightful and visually engaging book that aligns well with my love for children's literature and creative storytelling. The use of concrete poetry and the mix of collage and paint in the illustrations make it a unique and educational read. While it didn't have the same narrative drive as a Nancy Drew adventure, it was still a refreshing and inspiring book that I would recommend to anyone looking to spark creativity in young readers. The visual presentation and the way the text is integrated into the art are particularly noteworthy, making it a valuable addition to any children's library."
