  "review": "\"Essential Iron Man, Vol. 4\" was a bit of a letdown for me. While the introduction of iconic characters like Drax and Thanos adds some intrigue, the inconsistent writing and plot development are significant drawbacks. The story lacks the depth and emotional resonance I typically look for, especially in historical or emotionally profound narratives. The character relationships feel forced, and the overall direction of the plot is unclear and sometimes frustrating. Despite a few high points, this volume didn't meet my expectations."
