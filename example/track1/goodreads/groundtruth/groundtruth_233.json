  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Klods Hans\" is a charming and whimsical tale that captures the essence of classic Danish storytelling. While it has a delightful simplicity that appeals to children, the deeper themes of perseverance and the value of hard work resonate with adults as well. It's a pleasant read, though perhaps not as memorable as some of Hans Christian Andersen's more famous works."
