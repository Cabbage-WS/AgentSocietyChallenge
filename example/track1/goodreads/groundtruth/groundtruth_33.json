  "review": "\"Kunci Rahasia George ke Alam Semesta\" is a delightful blend of adventure and scientific education. The narrative, driven by the supercomputer Cosmos, effectively introduces complex concepts in an engaging and accessible manner. The characters, especially George and Annie, are well-developed and relatable, which made the story emotionally resonant. However, the antagonist's background could have been more fleshed out to add more depth to the plot. Despite this, the book\u2019s blend of humor and educational value, along with its subtle environmental messages, makes it a highly enjoyable read."
