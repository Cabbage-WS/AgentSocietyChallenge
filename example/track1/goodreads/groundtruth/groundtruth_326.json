  "review": "\"Make Way for Dyamonde Daniel\" is a delightful read that introduces a vibrant and intelligent young protagonist. Dyamonde's positive attitude and problem-solving skills make her a role model for children, and her interactions with the other new kid in class add a layer of intrigue and heart to the story. Nikki Grimes has crafted a charming and engaging series starter that will appeal to young readers looking for relatable characters and realistic scenarios."
