  "review": "\"Little Mouse Plays Peek-A-Boo\" is a delightful lift-the-flap book that I found to be both engaging and interactive, which aligns well with my preference for books that encourage participation and imagination. The hide-and-seek game is a clever way to keep children interested, and the inclusion of more complex vocabulary, such as 'flower pot' and 'watering can,' is a great way to expand their language skills. The tactile elements and colorful illustrations make it a perfect choice for young readers, and I can see this book inspiring a love for reading in children, much like 'Matilda' did for me. It's a charming addition to any toddler's bookshelf.\""
