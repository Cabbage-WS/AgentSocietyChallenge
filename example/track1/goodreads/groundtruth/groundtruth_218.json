  "review": "\"Una the Blade\" has a unique premise that initially caught my attention, especially the concept of a warrior single mom. However, the execution of the stories didn't quite live up to my expectations. The artwork is beautiful and varied, but some of the stories felt rough and unfinished. While I appreciate the attempt to create a strong female character, the overall narrative lacked the depth and humor I usually enjoy in my reads. It's a mixed bag, but I can see the potential for better things in future works."
