  "review": "\"The Ant Bully\" is a picture book that delivers a strong anti-bullying message, which is a valuable lesson for young readers. However, while the moral is commendable, the storytelling and pacing felt a bit simplistic compared to some of the more nuanced and engaging children's books I've read. The illustrations are charming, and the book is certainly suitable for younger audiences, but it didn't quite capture the depth or humor I enjoy in children's literature. It's a solid choice for a read-aloud, but it might not stand out in a crowded bookshelf."
