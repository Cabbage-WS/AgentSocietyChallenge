  "review": "I found \"Patti Cake and Her New Doll\" to be a delightful and heartwarming story. The interaction between Patti Cake, her dog Tootsie, and her new doll, On Sale, is both funny and endearing, making it a perfect read for young children. The illustrations are charming, and they complement the story's gentle messages about friendship and dealing with new fears."
