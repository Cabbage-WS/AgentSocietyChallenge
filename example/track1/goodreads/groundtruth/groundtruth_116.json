  "review": "\"The Stray\" is a charming and heartwarming story that resonates with its intended audience of children and families. The character of Henny is quirky and endearing, and her journey of self-discovery is both amusing and touching. However, the book's brevity and straightforward plot may not offer the depth or complexity I usually enjoy in my reads. While the pacing is brisk and the narrative is sweet, it lacks the intricate world-building and character development I typically gravitate towards. Despite these minor shortcomings, it's a delightful and relatable tale that I would recommend for a younger audience or as a light, family-friendly read."
