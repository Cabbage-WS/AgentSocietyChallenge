  "review": "\"Geisha\" offers a visually engaging and light-hearted story that aligns with my interest in graphic novels with detailed and dynamic art. The character of Jomi Sohodo, an android artist, is intriguing, and the blend of fine art with Japanese comics is a unique touch. However, the story feels somewhat limited and the art, while enjoyable, doesn't quite meet my standards for visual appeal. The misogynistic introduction and poor editing also detract from the overall experience, making it a mixed bag despite its creative premise."
