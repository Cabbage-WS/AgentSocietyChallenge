  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Elemental Gelade, Volume 3\" continues the engaging and dynamic story of the series, blending fantasy and action in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The character development is particularly strong, with each member of the cast growing in meaningful ways. While not as groundbreaking as some of my other favorite manga, it\u2019s a solid and enjoyable read that I would recommend to fans of the genre."
