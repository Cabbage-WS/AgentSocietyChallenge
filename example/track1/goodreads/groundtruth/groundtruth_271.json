  "review": "\"The Bradleys\" is a hilarious and biting satire that captures the essence of a dysfunctional American family with sharp wit and outrageous situations. Peter Bagge's unique art style and storytelling prowess make this graphic novel a must-read for anyone who appreciates dark humor and social commentary. Despite its 1980s roots, the issues and dynamics within the Bradley family remain eerily relevant today."
