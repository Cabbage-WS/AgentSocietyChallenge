  "review": "\"Hoshiyomi no Yogensha (Vol.1)\" by Hakusensha offers an intriguing blend of fortune-telling and assassination, which is a unique and engaging premise. The story revolves around Tia, an assassin who loses her will to live but finds a new purpose after being saved by Riis, the head of Grand's guards. While the plot is captivating and the characters are well-developed, the humor and cultural references might not be as relatable as those in \"Big Mushy Happy Lump,\" which I found deeply personal and hilarious. The manga format and the heartwarming aspects of Tia's journey are enjoyable, but the pacing and the depth of the story could be more refined. Overall, it's a solid read, but it doesn't quite hit the same emotional and humorous notes that I typically look for in my favorite books."
