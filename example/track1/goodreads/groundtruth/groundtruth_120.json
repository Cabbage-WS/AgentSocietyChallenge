  "review": "\"The Lessons\" is a beautifully crafted collection of poetry that resonates deeply with the soul. Joanne Diaz's passion for natural history, science, and music is evident in every line, creating a vivid and engaging reading experience. While the poetic elements and the author's personal connection are highly commendable, the book's focus on more abstract and philosophical themes might not align as strongly with my usual preference for heartfelt and humorous stories. Nonetheless, the lyrical quality and the profound insights make it a worthwhile read."
