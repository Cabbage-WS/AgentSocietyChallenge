  "review": "\"A.I. Love You, Vol. 05\" didn't quite hit the mark for me. While the Hitoshi / Saati subplot was engaging and well-developed, the risqu\u00e9 content was a bit too much, making it hard to stay invested in the story. The pacing felt off, and I found myself losing interest as the volume progressed. This series has potential, but this particular installment didn't align with my preferences for more subdued and character-driven narratives."
