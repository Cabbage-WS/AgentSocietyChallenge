  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Prophecy, Vol. 1\" is a compelling and suspenseful start to what promises to be an engaging series. The concept of a masked figure announcing future crimes through online videos is both chilling and timely, reflecting the modern fear of technology and its potential for misuse. The artwork is crisp and well-suited to the dark, psychological tone of the story, making it a must-read for fans of thriller manga."
