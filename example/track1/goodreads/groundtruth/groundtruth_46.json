  "review": "\"Prophecy, Vol. 1\" is an engaging and fast-paced manga that initially captivated me with its well-constructed characters and complex narrative. The story of the mysterious \"Homem-jornal\" and the cybercrime division's efforts to uncover his identity is intriguing and well-paced. However, the second and third volumes failed to live up to the promise of the first, leading to a sense of disappointment. The ending felt unsatisfactory, leaving me with a sense that the time invested in the series was somewhat wasted. Despite these shortcomings, the first volume's strong start and effective use of infodumps make it a decent read, but it falls short of being a standout in the genre."
