  "review": "\"The Early Works of Dr. Seuss Volume 2\" is a delightful collection that showcases the versatility and creativity of Dr. Seuss. The cartoons, adverts, and images are a treasure trove for fans of his whimsical style. While the pacing is not as fast as some of my favorite books, the visual and textual content is rich and engaging, offering a unique glimpse into the early career of a beloved author. The lack of a cohesive narrative is a minor drawback, but the individual pieces are charming and often hilarious, making this a must-read for anyone interested in the origins of Dr. Seuss's genius."
