  "stars": 1.0,
  "review": "\"Sensual Phrase, Vol. 7\" is a far cry from the middle-grade fiction and themes of friendship and personal growth that I typically enjoy. The story follows Aine, a budding poet, and her encounter with Sakuya, a charismatic lead singer who introduces her to a world of eroticism. While the plot has some intriguing elements, the focus on explicit content and the lack of substantial character development left me feeling disconnected. The pacing is uneven, and the narrative feels more like a series of events rather than a cohesive story. This book simply doesn't align with my preferences, and I found it difficult to engage with the characters or the plot."
