  "review": "\"Poke in the I\" is a delightful collection of concrete poems that engage both the eye and the mind. The clever use of text shapes and the whimsical illustrations make each poem a visual treat, perfect for sparking creativity and imagination in young readers. While not as memorable as some of my other favorites, it's a fun and engaging read that I would recommend for any children's bookshelf."
