  "review": "\"The Shrinking of Treehorn\" is a quirky and unique read, with its whimsical premise and dry humor. The illustrations by Edward Gorey are a standout, adding to the book's charm and nostalgic feel. However, the pacing is a bit slow, and the indifferent reactions of the adults in the story, while thematically interesting, didn't resonate with me as much as I hoped. The ending felt a bit rushed, which was disappointing given the engaging setup. Overall, it's a memorable book, but it didn't fully capture my interest like the historical fiction I typically enjoy."
