  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Toverien kesken\" is a Finnish book that I found to be a light and engaging read, suitable for a younger audience. The story is well-paced, and the characters are endearing, though the plot felt a bit predictable at times. It's a pleasant read, especially if you're interested in children's literature from different cultures."
