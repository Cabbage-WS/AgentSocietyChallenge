  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Breve til en ung digter og anden prosa\" is a beautifully written collection of letters that resonated deeply with me. Rilke's ability to convey profound thoughts through his correspondence is both inspiring and moving. While the book doesn't feature the multi-POV storytelling I usually enjoy, the depth and emotional impact of the letters more than made up for it. The book's exploration of personal growth and artistic expression aligns well with my appreciation for themes of identity and self-discovery. The only slight drawback is that the pacing can be a bit slow at times, but the content is rich and thought-provoking, making it a worthwhile read."
