  "review": "\"Le Chinois \u00e0 deux roues\" (Gil Jourdan #10) is an intriguing comic with a unique and consistent portrayal of rain and water, which adds a distinctive atmosphere to the story. The investigative narrative is engaging, and the visual elements are well-executed. However, the short length of the book (only 44 pages) and the focus on a continuous weather theme might not be as appealing as I typically prefer. While it's a good read, it doesn't fully capture my interest in the same way as books with more varied and visually engaging content."
