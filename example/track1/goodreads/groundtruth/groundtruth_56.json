  "review": "I found \"Le Chinois \u00e0 deux roues\" to be a delightful read, blending humor and adventure in a way that is both engaging and charming. The graphic novel format, with its vivid illustrations, brings the story to life, making it a quick yet satisfying read. It's a great addition to the Gil Jourdan series and a must-read for fans of classic comics."
