  "review": "\"A delightful collection of fairy tales by Oscar Wilde, 'astn princ a jin p bhy' offers a unique blend of wit and wisdom. The stories are beautifully crafted, with complex characters that challenge the reader's perception of good and evil. While the language is somewhat archaic, the timeless themes and moral questions make it a valuable read for both children and adults.\""
