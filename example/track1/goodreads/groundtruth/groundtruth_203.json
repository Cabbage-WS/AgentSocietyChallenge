  "review": "\"Les Chapeaux noirs\" (Spirou et Fantasio, #3) is an interesting read, particularly for its developing characters and engaging short stories. Spirou and Fantasio's personalities are just beginning to shine, making them intriguing and relatable. The adventures in the book are fun and transport the reader to different settings, which is quite enjoyable. However, the endings of the short stories feel a bit abrupt, which can be unsatisfying. While the book doesn't quite reach the high standards I set for strong character development and memorable narratives, it still offers a delightful and entertaining experience."
