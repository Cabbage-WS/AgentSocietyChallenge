  "review": "\"Tik-Tok of Oz\" is a delightful addition to the Oz series, and it aligns well with my appreciation for books that offer strong character development and unique plot elements. The introduction of Ann Soforth and the clockwork man Tik-Tok adds a charming layer of complexity to the narrative. The imaginative setting, particularly the tunnel through the Earth and the encounters with the Nome King, kept me engaged and entertained. While it might not delve as deeply into societal issues as some of my favorite books, it delivers a captivating and re-readable story with a touch of whimsy and adventure that I thoroughly enjoyed."
