  "review": "\"Tik-Tok of Oz\" is a delightful addition to the Oz series, introducing a new character, Ann Soforth, the Queen of Oogaboo, and the ever-reliable Tik-Tok. The story is filled with whimsical adventures and creative scenarios that are characteristic of L. Frank Baum\u2019s writing. While it may not be as groundbreaking as the earlier books in the series, it still captivates with its charm and imaginative storytelling, making it a pleasant read for both children and adults."
