  "review": "\"How We Sleep on the Nights We Don't Make Love\" by E. Ethelbert Miller is a poetic journey that resonates with the complexities of human emotion and social issues. The poetry is both simple and profound, touching on themes of love, family, and political strife. While some poems are more impactful than others, the overall collection is moving and thought-provoking. The author's ability to blend personal and political narratives creates a powerful reading experience. I particularly appreciated the tender and whimsical love poems, which complement the more serious and compassionate political pieces. A well-crafted and engaging collection that I would recommend to those who enjoy poetry with depth and heart.\""
