  "review": "\"Die Frau ist frei geboren - Olympe de Gouges\" is a compelling graphic novel that brings to life the story of a revolutionary woman ahead of her time. Catel and Bocquet do an excellent job of blending historical accuracy with a narrative that is both engaging and enlightening, making it a must-read for anyone interested in the history of women's rights and the French Revolution. The artwork is also noteworthy, capturing the essence of the era and the spirit of Olympe de Gouges."
