  "review": "\"The Lost Prince\" (The Bean, Volume 2) is a compelling continuation of the series, offering a richly detailed world and well-developed characters. The plot's growing complexity is handled masterfully, ensuring that the story remains engaging and easy to follow. The artwork is exceptional, enhancing the narrative's immersive quality. While I generally prefer a bit more character depth, the action-packed sequences and the intriguing background of the land more than make up for it. This volume is definitely a step up from the first, and I'm eager to see where the story goes next. Highly recommended for fans of epic fantasy.\""
