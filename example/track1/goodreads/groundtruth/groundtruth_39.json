  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"My Town\" is an engaging and visually rich book that introduces young readers to the basics of social and human geography. The fold-out pages and cross-sections of buildings are a neat feature, adding an interactive element that can keep children interested. However, as someone who appreciates re-readable content and stories that engage beyond just the artwork, I found that this book, while educational and fun, doesn't quite hit the mark for repeated readings. It's a solid addition to a children's library but may not hold the same appeal for older readers or those looking for a more narrative-driven experience."
