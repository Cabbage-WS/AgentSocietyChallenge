  "review": "\"My Rotten Life\" offers a quirky and humorous take on the zombie genre, which aligns with my interest in unique and entertaining stories. The book's quick and fun read quality is a plus, and the gross-out humor, while not my favorite, adds a layer of entertainment that might appeal to its target audience. However, the narrative choices, such as the use of two narrators, and the sometimes over-the-top gross humor, detract from the overall experience. While I enjoyed the creative premise and the engaging plot, it didn't quite reach the high standards I have for art and storytelling. Still, it's a solid read for those who enjoy light-hearted, humorous fantasy."
