  "review": "\"Seeing Things\" by Robin Klein explores the challenging life of Miranda, who is dealing with an overwhelmed grandmother and a troubled family. The introduction of Miranda's clairvoyant visions adds an intriguing element to the story, though the plot can feel a bit heavy at times. It's a thoughtful read that touches on complex family dynamics and the supernatural, making it a solid choice for young adult readers interested in these themes."
