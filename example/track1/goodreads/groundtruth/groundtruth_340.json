  "review": "Michael McClure's \"Mysteriosos and Other Poems\" is a profound and evocative collection that resonates deeply with its themes of nature, war, and human connection. The poems are rich in imagery and emotion, particularly the long travel poem about the elephant in the Indian forest, which captures a moment of profound recognition and peace. McClure's willingness to explore the complexities of the human experience, from the fierce to the gentle, makes this a compelling read."
