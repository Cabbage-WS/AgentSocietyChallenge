  "review": "\"Where's Rodney?\" is a delightful and transformative story that resonated deeply with me. The book beautifully captures the essence of a child's unbridled energy and the profound impact of nature on one's well-being. Rodney's journey from a restless, misunderstood boy to someone who finds solace and wonder in the great outdoors is both heartwarming and inspiring. The illustrations by Floyd Cooper are breathtaking, adding a layer of richness and emotion to the narrative. This book not only celebrates the power of nature but also highlights the importance of diverse and inclusive spaces, making it a must-read for children and adults alike."
