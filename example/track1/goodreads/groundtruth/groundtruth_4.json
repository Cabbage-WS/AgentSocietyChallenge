  "review": "\"The Collected Poetry of Dorothy Parker\" is a treasure trove for poetry enthusiasts. Parker's wit and sharp observations on life and love are both poignant and timeless, making her work as relevant today as it was decades ago. While some poems may feel a bit dated, the overall collection is a testament to her brilliance and a must-read for anyone interested in American literature."
