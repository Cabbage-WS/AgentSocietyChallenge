  "review": "\"The Collected Poetry of Dorothy Parker\" is a compelling and intellectually stimulating read. Parker's wit and intelligence shine through in her verses, making each poem a thought-provoking experience. The themes of mortality and the human condition resonate deeply, aligning well with my appreciation for literature that evokes emotional and philosophical reflection. While some may find the intensity overwhelming, I enjoyed the poetry in measured doses, savoring the intricate language and sharp observations. It's a collection that demands and rewards careful consideration.\""
