  "review": "\"How to Build the Ghost in Your Attic\" is a fascinating blend of poetry and narrative that challenges the reader with its innovative language and fantastical elements. The poetic language is both cheeky and profound, making for a truly unique reading experience. The blend of futuristic sci-fi and mythological themes, particularly the Oedipus shadow-text, adds depth and complexity. While the book can be dense and requires a bit of extra effort to fully appreciate, the moments of sheer brilliance and the engaging, thought-provoking content make it well worth the investment. If you enjoy literature that pushes the boundaries and offers a fresh perspective, this book is a must-read.\""
