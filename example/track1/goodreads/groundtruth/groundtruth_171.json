  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Voces de una estrella distante\" is a beautifully crafted story that resonates on multiple levels. The romantic and emotional depth, combined with the unique concept of delayed communication, creates a poignant narrative that I found deeply moving. The character development and the way the protagonists' feelings are portrayed are both touching and realistic. While it doesn't feature superheroes or historical settings, the themes of love, distance, and the passage of time are universally compelling. The pacing is steady, and the melancholy atmosphere is well-maintained throughout, making it a memorable read. However, it doesn't quite reach the heights of my favorite superhero comics or historical fiction, which is why I've given it a 4.0. Still, it's a book that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a touching and well-told story."
