  "review": "\"Little Tree\" by e.e. cummings is a charming poem, but it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped. The narrative is simple and sweet, but it felt a bit too slow and lacked the engaging momentum I usually look for in a story. The illustrations are warm and well-done, but they didn't bring the characters to life in a way that made me feel a deep connection. While the themes of family and holiday spirit are lovely, the characters themselves didn't evoke much emotion, and I found it hard to get truly invested in their journey. Overall, it's a nice read, but it didn't meet my expectations for a more dynamic and engaging story."
