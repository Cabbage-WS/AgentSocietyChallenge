  "review": "\"The Four-Story Mistake\" is a charming and heartwarming read that aligns well with my preference for series that improve with each installment. The Melendy family's adjustment to their new home in the countryside is both engaging and relatable, with a strong focus on family dynamics and the children's resourcefulness. While the story can be a bit sweet, it never feels overly cloying. The detailed descriptions and the children's adventures add a layer of depth that makes the book enjoyable, though some elements might seem a bit outdated. Overall, it's a delightful addition to the Melendy Quartet."
