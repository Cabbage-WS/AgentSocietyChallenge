  "review": "\"I found this collection of Hafez's poetry to be a deep and enriching read. The language, though sometimes dense, is beautifully translated, capturing the essence of the original Persian. It's a book that requires a slow, thoughtful read, and I appreciate the insight it provides into the cultural and historical context of these poems.\""
