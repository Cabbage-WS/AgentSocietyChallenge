  "review": "While I have a deep appreciation for the original \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series, this comic adaptation falls short of my expectations. The story is charming and retains some of the humor and whimsy of the original, but the severe abridgment and the small, difficult-to-read text in the German version are significant drawbacks. The visual appeal is lacking, making it a less engaging read. The characters, while iconic, don't have the depth or development I typically enjoy, and the pacing feels rushed. Overall, it's a disappointing adaptation that doesn't do justice to the original work."
