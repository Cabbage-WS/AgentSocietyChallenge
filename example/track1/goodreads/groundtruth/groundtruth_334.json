  "review": "\"Very Special Friends\" is a gentle and sweet story about the value of friendship, with beautiful illustrations that complement the text. However, as someone who leans towards more experimental and surreal narratives, I found the story to be predictable and lacking in depth. The pacing is slow and the plot is straightforward, which doesn't align with my preference for unconventional and mind-bending storytelling. While it's a lovely book for young children, it doesn't resonate with my tastes."
