  "review": "\"Cinnamon\" is a beautifully illustrated and captivating story that resonates with the magic of fairy tales. The unique character of Cinnamon, with her pearls for eyes, adds a mysterious and enchanting element to the narrative. While it didn't quite reach the heights of some of my favorite poetry collections, it's a delightful read that I would recommend, especially for fans of Neil Gaiman's work and those who enjoy rich, imaginative storytelling."
