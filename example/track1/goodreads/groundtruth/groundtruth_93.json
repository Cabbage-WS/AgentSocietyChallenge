  "review": "\"California Dreamin'\" is a captivating and beautifully illustrated graphic novel that resonates with my love for strong character development and engaging narratives. Cass Elliot's journey from a young, aspiring singer in Baltimore to a rising star in New York is both inspiring and deeply moving. The book's unique narrative style, which blends different perspectives and gradually reveals the depth of Cass's personality, makes it a standout read. The illustrations are simple yet powerful, enhancing the emotional impact of the story. While the book is biographical, it retains a sense of heart and humor that I deeply appreciate, making it a truly enjoyable and memorable experience."
