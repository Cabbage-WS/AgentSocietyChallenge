  "review": "\"El Amante Drag\u00f3n #2\" by Mayu Shinjo offers a blend of intense romance and mafia intrigue that can be both captivating and a bit overwhelming. The characters, especially the young protagonists, are well-developed, and the plot is engaging, though some parts feel rushed and could benefit from more depth. Despite its flaws, it's a thrilling read for fans of the genre."
