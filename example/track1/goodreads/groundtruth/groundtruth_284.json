  "review": "\"HOLiC 16\" did not capture my attention as I had hoped. The pacing felt slow and overly focused on character development, which, while important, didn't keep me engaged. Watanuki's resemblance to Yuko was a bit forced, and the lack of significant plot progression made the story feel stagnant. While the artistic style and emotional depth are praised by many, I found the narrative a bit too drawn out and less action-packed than I prefer."
