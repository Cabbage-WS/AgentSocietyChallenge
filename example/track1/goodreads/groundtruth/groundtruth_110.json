  "review": "\"No More Poems About the Moon\" is a stunning collection that resonated deeply with my love for poetry and creative expression. Michael Roberts has an uncanny ability to transform the mundane into something profound and beautiful, much like the way Jericho Brown's words captivated me. The inventiveness and emotional honesty in each poem brought a sense of authenticity that is rare and refreshing. This book is a must-read for anyone who appreciates the power of poetry to illuminate the everyday with a new, ecstatic light."
