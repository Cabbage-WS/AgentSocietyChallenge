  "review": "\"Sesso? Fai da te!\" by Giobbe Covatta seems like an amusing read, with its quirky and humorous take on sex and relationships. While the premise is intriguing and the author's unique style is evident, I found the execution somewhat hit-or-miss. It's a quick, light-hearted read that might appeal to those looking for a laugh, but it lacks depth and could be more polished."
