  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Descendants of Darkness Vol. 2\" does not align well with my usual preferences. While the book is a manga, which is a form of graphic storytelling, it focuses heavily on supernatural and fantasy elements, which are not my primary interests. The plot, involving a detective and his partner dealing with supernatural threats, feels too action-packed and lacks the introspective, personal growth themes I typically enjoy. The characters, while dynamic, do not delve deeply into the emotional and existential questions that I find compelling. The artwork is well-done, but it doesn't make up for the lack of depth in the narrative and character development. Overall, this book was a bit of a miss for me."
