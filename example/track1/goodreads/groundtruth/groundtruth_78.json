  "review": "\"Hugo The Happy Starfish\" is a charming and heartwarming children's book that resonated with me. The story's focus on self-esteem and the importance of being true to oneself is both uplifting and valuable, especially for young readers. Hugo's journey is relatable and the lessons he learns are presented in a gentle, engaging way. The illustrations are bright and colorful, adding to the appeal. While the random Spanish translations could be improved, the overall message and execution make this a wonderful book to share."
