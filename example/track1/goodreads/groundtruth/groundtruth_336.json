  "review": "\"Gezicht in de mist\" is a compelling and engaging read that resonates with my love for middle-grade fiction. The story of Kiezel, a boy with a mysterious past and unique abilities, is both intriguing and heartwarming. The characters, especially Jessie and Kiezel, are well-developed and their interactions are filled with humor and genuine emotion. The plot, while a bit slow at times, builds up to a satisfying climax. The themes of friendship, courage, and self-discovery are beautifully woven into the narrative, making it a wonderful read for both children and adults. Although it doesn't quite reach the high bar set by my favorite books like \"Wonder,\" it is still a highly enjoyable and recommendable story."
