  "review": "\"Oscar Wilde's 'Aesten Prince and Other Tales' is a delightful collection of fairy tales that are both soul-soothing and thought-provoking. The stories are rich in allegory and explore complex human emotions and traits, which I found engaging and resonant. Wilde's writing is witty and insightful, making each tale a pleasure to read. While the pacing is somewhat slow at times, the depth of the themes and the beauty of the prose make it a worthwhile read. I particularly enjoyed how the stories challenge simplistic notions of good and evil, encouraging deeper reflection. Highly recommended for those who appreciate sophisticated and morally nuanced storytelling.\""
