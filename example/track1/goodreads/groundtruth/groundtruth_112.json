  "review": "\"Alice in Wonderland\" is a classic that never fails to enchant. The restoration of Ralph Steadman's 1968 illustrations adds a fresh, dynamic visual layer that complements the whimsical and satirical text. While the book's surreal and sometimes bizarre elements might not align perfectly with my preference for strong, realistic character development, the humor and social commentary are spot-on. The unique blend of fantasy and social critique keeps the narrative engaging and thought-provoking, making it a delightful read despite its occasional eccentricities."
