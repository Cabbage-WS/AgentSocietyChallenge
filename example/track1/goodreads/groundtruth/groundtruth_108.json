  "review": "\"Orphan Black #4\" is a compelling graphic novel that continues the intricate and thrilling story of the clones. The character development is strong, with each clone having their own unique and engaging storyline. The relationship dynamics, especially between Cosima and Delphine, add depth and emotional resonance. While I found the pacing to be well-maintained and the plot twists exciting, I did feel that some aspects of the clones' backgrounds, particularly Cosima's, could have been explored more thoroughly. Overall, it's a solid addition to the series that keeps me eagerly anticipating the next installment.\""
