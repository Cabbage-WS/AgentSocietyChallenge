  "review": "\"Scam on the Cam\" is a delightful addition to the Sesame Seade series, blending humor and mystery in a way that keeps the reader entertained. The protagonist, Sesame Seade, is a dynamic and engaging character, and the plot involving a treasure chest and a mysterious illness among rowing team members is intriguing. However, while the book is well-suited for younger, advanced readers, it occasionally feels a bit too simplistic and lacks the depth and complexity I typically enjoy in mystery narratives. The pacing is solid, and the setting of Cambridge adds a charming backdrop, but the overall story didn't quite reach the level of excitement and originality found in the previous books in the series. Still, it's a fun read that will likely appeal to fans of the genre."
