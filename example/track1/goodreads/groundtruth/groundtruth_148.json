  "review": "\"The Secret Garden\" is a timeless classic that captivates with its enchanting story of transformation and growth. Mary Lennox's journey from a spoiled, lonely child to a vibrant, caring young girl is both heartwarming and inspiring. The vivid descriptions of the garden and the Yorkshire moors make this book a true delight, and the themes of friendship and the power of nature resonate deeply."
