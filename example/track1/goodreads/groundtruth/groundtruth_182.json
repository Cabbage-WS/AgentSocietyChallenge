  "review": "\"Detective School Q Vol. 1\" is a delightful read that aligns well with my preferences for light, engaging stories with a touch of humor and cuteness. The characters, especially Kyu, are endearing and well-developed, each bringing unique skills to the table. The mysteries are cleverly constructed and keep you guessing, making it a fun and quick read. While the fan service and redundant recaps can be a bit distracting, they don't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment. I particularly appreciated the logical deductions and the teamwork dynamics, which made solving the cases feel both exciting and satisfying. This book is a great choice for anyone looking for a light-hearted, entertaining detective story."
