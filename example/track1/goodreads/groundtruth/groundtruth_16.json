  "review": "\"Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t de Omar Khayyam\" is a fascinating collection of quatrains that offer a profound glimpse into the mind of a 12th-century Persian polymath. The aphorisms are both brilliant and thought-provoking, resonating with themes of life, love, and existential contemplation. While it doesn't feature the strong, relatable characters I usually enjoy, the poetic depth and cultural richness make it a compelling read. The translation by Edward FitzGerald is beautifully crafted, though I found some of the philosophical musings a bit dense at times. Overall, it's a highly enjoyable and enriching read, especially for those interested in classical literature and poetry."
