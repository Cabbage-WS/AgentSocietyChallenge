  "review": "\"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, translated by Edward FitzGerald, is a profound and timeless collection of quatrains that offer a deep dive into the philosophical and poetic mind of a 12th-century Persian polymath. Each stanza resonates with wisdom and a subtle critique of the human condition, making it a must-read for lovers of classic literature and poetry.\""
