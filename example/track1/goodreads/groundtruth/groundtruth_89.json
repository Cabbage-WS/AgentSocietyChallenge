  "review": "I found \"Ichiro\" to be a compelling blend of mythology and coming-of-age storytelling, with rich, evocative art that complements the narrative beautifully. The character's journey of self-discovery and the exploration of his dual cultural identity resonated with me deeply. It's a touching and visually stunning read that I would recommend to fans of graphic novels and fantasy alike."
