  "review": "\"A Change of Lace\" by the Sew Zoey series is a disappointment, especially considering my preference for strong character development and a blend of humor and depth. The book takes a turn for the angsty and depressing, which is a significant departure from the fun and light-hearted tone that is essential for middle-grade literature. Zoey and Priti's character arcs become overly focused on trivial concerns that detract from the story's enjoyment. The overall mood is dreary, and the series seems to have lost its charm. This book fails to meet my expectations for a well-rounded and engaging read."
