  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Hadi Ama Baba!\" by Christine Nostlinger is a light and casual read that serves well for a break from heavier literature. While the book touches on relevant themes for young adults, such as family dynamics and the challenges of moving, it feels somewhat clich\u00e9 and lacks the depth and originality I typically look for in coming-of-age stories. The characters are engaging, but their arcs are predictable, and the plot doesn't offer much new ground. It's a pleasant read, but it didn't resonate with me as strongly as \"Anne of Green Gables\" or the nuanced series by Wilson."
