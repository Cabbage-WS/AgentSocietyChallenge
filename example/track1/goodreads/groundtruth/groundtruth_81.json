  "review": "\"Curious George Goes to the Zoo\" is a delightful and engaging book that perfectly captures the curiosity and antics of a mischievous little monkey. The story is filled with humor and heart, making it a fantastic choice for children and young readers. The illustrations are vibrant and detailed, enhancing the narrative and making it easier to hold the attention of 2nd graders. George's friendship with the baby rhino is particularly touching, and the birthday party at the end is a charming conclusion. This book is a must-read for anyone looking to captivate young minds with a fun and educational story.\""
