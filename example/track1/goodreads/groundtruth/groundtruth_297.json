  "review": "\"Limbo #5\" offers a rich, emotional journey through dreams, memories, and the spaces in-between, which aligns well with my preference for emotionally impactful stories. The narrative's snappy dialogue and compelling character development, especially Sandy's quest to find the missing detective, kept me thoroughly engaged. While the pacing is steady, it provides necessary background and explanations that enhance the overall experience, making it a satisfying read. However, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the books that have made me cry, but it's still a strong, enjoyable installment in the series."
