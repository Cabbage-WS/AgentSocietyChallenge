  "review": "\"The Carnival Ghost\" is a light-hearted, albeit predictable, entry in the Sweet Valley Twins series. While it offers a mix of mystery and supernatural elements, the plot feels too conventional and lacks the depth and originality I typically seek in my reading. The characters, Jessica and Elizabeth, are somewhat flat and their interactions, while intended to be engaging, come across as overly simplistic. The supernatural elements, particularly the fortune-teller and the mysterious Claire, could have been more intriguing, but they fall short of creating a genuinely suspenseful or thought-provoking narrative. Overall, while the book is easy to read, it doesn't challenge or captivate in the way I prefer, making it a rather forgettable experience.\""
