  "review": "\"Faster Than Light #7\" offers a compelling sci-fi narrative that aligns with my interest in character-driven stories and emotional depth. Captain Forest's struggle against The Council adds a layer of tension and intrigue, making the plot engaging. However, the story's focus on action and space opera elements, while exciting, doesn't quite delve into the human condition as deeply as I prefer. The comic format is well-executed, and the artwork is visually appealing, enhancing the overall reading experience. The nod to \"Battlestar Galactica\" was a nice touch, bringing a sense of familiarity and nostalgia. While it's not my absolute favorite, it's a solid addition to the series and worth a read for fans of the genre."
