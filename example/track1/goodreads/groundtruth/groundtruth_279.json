  "review": "\"Bad Rats\" is an interesting read, particularly for its unique take on nonconformity and creativity. The illustrations are charming and add a lot to the story, making it engaging for young readers. However, the plot and character development felt a bit inconsistent, especially with the elder rat's sudden change of heart. While the message about embracing creativity is valuable, the execution could have been more compelling. It's a decent book, but it doesn't quite reach the high standards I have for children's literature that both entertains and teaches meaningful lessons."
