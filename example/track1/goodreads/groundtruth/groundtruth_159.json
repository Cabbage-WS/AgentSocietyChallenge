  "review": "\"My Rotten Friend\" is a charming and humorous story that would be a delightful read for younger children, especially those who enjoy a bit of zombie fun. The illustrations are engaging, and the story of friendship is heartwarming. However, as someone who values deeper and more complex narratives, I found the content a bit too light and simplistic. While it didn't resonate with my personal taste for more substantial themes, it's still a cute and entertaining choice for its target audience."
