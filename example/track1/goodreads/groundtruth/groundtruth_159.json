  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Snail in the Woods\" offers a gentle and educational journey through a snail's life cycle, which is both informative and engaging for young readers. The illustrations complement the text nicely, though the story itself is quite simple and might not captivate older children or adults. It's a good choice for early readers or as a learning tool in a classroom setting."
