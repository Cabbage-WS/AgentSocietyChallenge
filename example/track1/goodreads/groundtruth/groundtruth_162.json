  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Howard Lovecraft FCBD 2016 Edition\" is a short, illustrated comic that doesn't quite align with my usual preferences. While it's engaging for its intended younger audience, the character development is minimal, and the story lacks the depth and moral complexity I typically enjoy. The illustrations are decent, but the plot feels too simplistic and doesn't offer the profound life lessons or character growth I value in my reading. It's a quick read that might appeal to fans of the genre, but it didn't resonate with me on a deeper level."
