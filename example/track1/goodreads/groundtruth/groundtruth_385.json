  "review": "\"I Want to Do Yoga Too\" is a charming and engaging children's book that resonates well with my preferences. The story of Hallie and her desire to join her mother's yoga class is both relatable and heartwarming. The illustrations are cute and vibrant, enhancing the narrative and making it more interactive for young readers. Hallie's character is spunky and relatable, and the babysitter's gentle guidance adds a nice touch of patience and inclusion. While the book might not be as imaginative or humorous as some of my favorites, it still delivers a fun and educational experience that both children and adults can enjoy. The subtle message of patience and the joy of learning new activities is a welcome addition to any child's library.\""
