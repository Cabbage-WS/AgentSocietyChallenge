  "review": "\"The Da Vinci Cod and Other Illustrations To Unwritten Books\" is a unique and whimsical collection that plays with literary classics through humorous illustrations and puns. While it's a clever and entertaining concept that bibliophiles will appreciate, it doesn't align strongly with my preference for deep, culturally rich narratives. The book's light-hearted nature and focus on visual humor make it a fun read, but it lacks the depth and thematic complexity I typically seek in my reading. It's a nice diversion, but not a standout for me."
