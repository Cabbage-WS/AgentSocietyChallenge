  "review": "\"Shouldn't You Be in School?\" by Lemony Snicket is a delightful and witty addition to the \"All the Wrong Questions\" series. The clever wordplay and sophisticated humor make it an enjoyable read for all ages, aligning well with my preference for beautifully written stories. While the plot is engaging and the mystery intriguing, it doesn't delve as deeply into themes of personal transformation or redemption as some of my favorite books do. Nonetheless, it's a fun and clever read that kept me entertained from start to finish."
