  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"King Me\" is a powerful and evocative collection of poetry that delves into the complex themes of race, sacrifice, and the human condition. Reeves' use of vivid imagery and historical references, such as the tragic story of Emmett Till, adds depth and emotional resonance to the work. It's a thought-provoking read that stays with you long after the final page."
