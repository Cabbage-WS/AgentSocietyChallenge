  "review": "\"Runaway Pony\" is a light and simple read, which might appeal to its young target audience. However, as someone who appreciates more depth and engaging storytelling, I found the narrative to be a bit shallow and the writing choppy. The illustrations, while cute, often overshadowed the text, making the story feel less substantial. While it has its nostalgic charm, it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped, especially compared to more robust and meaningful graphic novels like \"Nimona.\""
