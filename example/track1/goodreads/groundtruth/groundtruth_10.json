  "review": "While \"Ghost Dog Secrets\" has garnered a lot of praise, particularly for its engaging plot and strong message about animal welfare, it doesn't align well with my personal preferences. As someone who deeply appreciates the nuanced and poetic expressions of Urdu literature, I found the straightforward and sometimes predictable narrative of this book to be lacking in depth and complexity. The detailed descriptions of animal abuse were also quite distressing and difficult to read, which detracted from my overall enjoyment. While the book is well-suited for younger readers, it didn't resonate with me on a deeper level."
