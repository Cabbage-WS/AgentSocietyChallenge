  "review": "\"Shapes\" is a delightful introduction to the artistic element of shapes, offering a unique blend of visual and educational content. The book effectively uses examples from the Museum of Modern Art to illustrate how different shapes can convey various visual ideas and emotions. The interactive approach, with questions that engage the reader, aligns well with my preference for books that are both educational and engaging. While it may not have the depth of narrative found in my favorite novels, it successfully sparks creativity and curiosity, making it a valuable addition to any child's library."
