  "review": "\"Star Trek Starfleet Academy #4 (of 5)\" offers a solid continuation of the series, with a well-connected narrative that ties past and present events together effectively. The introduction of a century-old mystery adds an intriguing layer to the plot, and the character development, particularly for Uhura, is commendable. However, as a reader who prefers more cozy and less space-oriented adventures, the sci-fi elements and the fast-paced nature of the story didn't fully resonate with my usual preferences. The artwork is engaging, and the overall reading experience is satisfying, but it doesn't quite hit the mark for me as much as books focused on more grounded, character-driven narratives."
