  "review": "\"ENDGAME - Poetry of Retirement\" offers a thoughtful and poignant exploration of the retirement phase of life. The poems are reflective, capturing the nuances of winding down a career and embracing a new chapter. While not every piece resonated with me, the overall collection provides a comforting and insightful look into the experiences of retirees, making it a worthwhile read for those approaching or already in retirement, as well as for anyone interested in the human condition."
