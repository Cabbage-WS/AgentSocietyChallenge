  "review": "\"ENDGAME - Poetry of Retirement\" is a thoughtful collection that explores the nuances of retirement through well-structured sections and diverse topics. The author's notes add depth and context, which I appreciated. However, as someone who values a broader range of themes and a more contemporary feel, I found the book a bit too niche and more relevant to those already in or approaching retirement. The mix of humor and reality is engaging, but the reading style required a bit more patience than I usually have. Overall, it's a solid read, but it didn't fully resonate with my preferences for more varied and modern themes.\""
