  "review": "\"Stagger Lee\" is an intriguing graphic novel that delves into the true story behind a legendary murder. While the historical context and the art are commendable, the characters felt flat and underdeveloped, making it hard to connect emotionally. The pacing is slow, and the jumping between timelines and fictionalized plots adds to the confusion. Despite its educational value, it lacks the emotional depth and engaging narrative I usually look for in a book."
