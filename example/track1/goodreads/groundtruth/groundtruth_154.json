  "review": "\"Death's Academy\" is a delightful read that aligns well with my love for humorous and adventurous stories. The blend of grim reapers, guardian angels, and unicorns in a candy village is incredibly creative and engaging. The main character, Midnight, is relatable and his journey is both entertaining and heartwarming. While the first half of the book is a bit slow, the story picks up momentum and becomes a thrilling, fast-paced adventure. The humor is spot-on, making it a perfect choice for both younger and adult readers. Despite a few predictable elements, the overall experience is highly enjoyable and aligns with my preference for light, uplifting stories."
