  "review": "\"A Giraffe Did One\" is a playful and engaging picture book that will likely elicit giggles from young readers as they try to guess what the animals are doing. The story's predictability and the humorous ending make it a fun read-aloud choice for parents and educators. However, the simplicity of the plot and the somewhat predictable punchline might not hold the attention of older children for long."
