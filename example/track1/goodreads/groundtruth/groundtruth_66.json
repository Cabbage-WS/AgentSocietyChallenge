  "review": "\"Toby Alone\" is a captivating read that resonates with my love for children's literature and fantasy. The story of Toby, who is only 1.5 millimeters tall, living in a world within a great oak tree, is both imaginative and engaging. The themes of family, discovery, and the fight against exploitation are well-woven into the narrative, making it a compelling and thought-provoking tale. While not as nostalgic as some of my childhood favorites, the book's unique premise and well-developed characters make it a delightful and memorable read. The pacing is steady, and the world-building is detailed, which kept me engaged from start to finish. Highly recommended for fans of fantasy and those who enjoy a blend of adventure and environmental themes.\""
