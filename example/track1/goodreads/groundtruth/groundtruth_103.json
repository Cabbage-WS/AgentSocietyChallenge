  "review": "\"Refuge\" by University of Pittsburgh Press is a concise collection of poetry that, while not my usual fare of classic literature and Shakespearean plays, offers a unique and reflective experience. The 88-page paperback is well-crafted, with a poetic style that resonates with themes of nature and personal introspection. However, as someone who typically enjoys more structured and narrative-driven works, I found the free-form nature of the poems a bit challenging to fully engage with. The book's pacing and the depth of its content are commendable, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of the masterpieces I often gravitate towards. It's a solid read, but not one that I would consider a personal favorite."
