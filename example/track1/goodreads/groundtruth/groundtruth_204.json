  "review": "\"Oh Dear Geoffrey!\" is a charming picture book with beautiful illustrations that are visually engaging and rich in detail. The story of Geoffrey, the clumsy giraffe, is endearing and relatable, especially for young readers who might feel awkward or out of place. However, the pacing of the story is a bit uneven, and it occasionally feels a bit too long for a read-aloud, which can make it less engaging for its intended audience. While the message of friendship and self-acceptance is positive, it could be more clearly resolved. Despite these issues, the book is still a pleasant read, but it doesn't quite meet the high standards I have for middle grade fiction, which is why I'm giving it a 3.0."
