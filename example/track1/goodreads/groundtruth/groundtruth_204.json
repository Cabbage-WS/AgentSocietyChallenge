  "review": "\"First Hockey Words\" by Per-Henrik Gurth is a charming and educational picture book that introduces young readers to the basics of hockey through a lively story featuring animal characters. The vocabulary words are well-integrated into the narrative, making it both fun and informative. While it may not be as deep as some other children's books, it serves its purpose well and is a delightful read for young hockey enthusiasts."
