  "review": "\"Komta nk\" is a delightful adventure that perfectly aligns with my love for children's books, especially those with elements of fantasy and friendship. The Moomins, with their unique personalities and resilience, are charming and engaging. The story of their journey to the mountains, filled with briers, mysterious creatures, and a race against time, is both imaginative and thrilling. The illustrations are beautiful, enhancing the magical world of Moominvalley. This book is a wonderful addition to my collection and a must-read for anyone who enjoys enchanting tales of friendship and adventure."
