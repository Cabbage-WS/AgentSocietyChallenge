  "review": "\"Batman Beyond (2016-) #7\" is a solid addition to the series, offering a mix of action and character development that fans of the animated series will appreciate. The artwork is dynamic and captures the futuristic aesthetic well. However, the story could delve deeper into the themes and character motivations to fully engage readers who are new to the Batman Beyond universe."
