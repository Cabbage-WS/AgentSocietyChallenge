  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Algures entre as sombras\" is a graphic novel that resonates with my love for the blend of humor and deep, existential themes. The artwork is truly magnificent, making each page a visual feast. The anthropomorphic characters, especially Blacksad, are intricately designed and add a unique twist to the noir setting. While the plot is classic and perhaps a bit predictable, the emotional depth and the vivid portrayal of 1950s New York more than make up for it. I found the pacing to be just right, keeping me engaged throughout. However, I do wish the story had a bit more originality and development, which is why I can't give it a perfect 5.0. Still, it's a compelling read that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys well-crafted graphic novels."
