  "review": "\"The Norton Book of Friendship\" is a collection that, while ambitious in scope, falls short of my expectations. As someone who values deep character explorations and graphic novels, I found the text to be outdated and less engaging. The lack of current examples and the absence of visual elements typical in graphic novels made it difficult for me to connect with the stories. While the concept of exploring literary friendships is intriguing, the execution felt stale and not reflective of modern relationships. I appreciate the historical value, but it doesn't align well with my preferred reading style."
