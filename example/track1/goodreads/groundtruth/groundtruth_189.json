  "review": "\"Black Book of Poems\" by Vincent Hunanyan is a powerful and moving collection that resonated with me deeply. Each poem is crafted with such emotional depth and authenticity that it feels like a personal conversation. The poem \"Lullaby\" particularly touched me, evoking a sense of gentle yet profound connection. The brevity and impact of the poems align well with my preference for well-paced and engaging narratives. I found myself reflecting on the words long after I finished reading, a sign of a truly impactful book. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a meaningful and beautifully written collection of poetry."
