  "review": "\"The Incal\" is a visually stunning and mind-bending graphic novel that combines the talents of Moebius and Jodorowsky. The story of John Difool and the mystical Incal artifact is both surreal and engaging, offering a unique blend of science fiction and philosophical inquiry. I found the artwork particularly captivating, making this a must-read for fans of the genre."
