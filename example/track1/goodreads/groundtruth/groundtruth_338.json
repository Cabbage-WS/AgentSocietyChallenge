  "review": "\"Rumble #1\" is a graphic novel, a format I generally find too simplistic, as my imagination usually paints a more vivid picture. The story introduces a dark urban fantasy setting with intriguing characters, but the lack of depth in character development and plot progression, typical of a first volume, left me wanting more. The artwork was decent, but it didn't compensate for the story's underdeveloped elements. While there's potential, it didn't align well with my preferences for more nuanced and humorous writing."
