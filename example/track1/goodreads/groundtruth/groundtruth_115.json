  "review": "\"The Collected Works of Phillis Wheatley\" is a significant historical compilation, and while it doesn't align perfectly with my usual preferences for children's literature and engaging narratives, it offers a profound look into the early African American literary tradition. Wheatley's poetry is beautifully crafted, and her devotion to faith is evident, which some might find inspiring. However, the book's academic tone and historical context make it less accessible and less engaging for the younger audience I typically enjoy reading about. Despite this, it's a valuable addition to any collection focused on American literature and history.\""
