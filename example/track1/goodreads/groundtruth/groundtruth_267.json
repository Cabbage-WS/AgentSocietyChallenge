  "review": "\"Lepakkoluola is a refreshing anthology that brings to light the often-overlooked stories of women in history and mythology. The diverse range of characters, from trolls to centaurs and witches to soldiers, provides a rich tapestry of narratives that are both engaging and thought-provoking. The artwork is stunning, and the themes of love and empowerment resonate strongly, making this a must-read for fans of comics and LGBTQ+ literature.\""
