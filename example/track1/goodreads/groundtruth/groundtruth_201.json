  "review": "\"First Hockey Words\" by Per-Henrik Gurth is a colorful and engaging picture book that introduces young readers to the world of hockey. While the book's vivid illustrations and simple vocabulary are commendable, the story itself lacks the depth and humor I typically enjoy in books. The pacing is a bit slow, and the narrative doesn't offer much beyond a basic introduction to the sport. The book's educational value is clear, but it falls short in terms of entertainment and writing quality, which are important to me."
