  "review": "\"Complete Minimal Poems\" by Aram Saroyan is a unique and intriguing collection that explores the boundaries of poetry through minimalism and concrete forms. While I appreciate the creativity and the innovative use of language, the book's style sometimes feels too abstract and lacks the engaging narrative and character development I often seek. The poems are thought-provoking and memorable, but the inconsistent quality and overuse of certain tricks, like misspelling and punctuation, occasionally detract from the overall impact. Despite these drawbacks, the book offers a fresh perspective and is worth exploring for those interested in experimental poetry."
