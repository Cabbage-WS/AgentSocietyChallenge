  "review": "\"Sarah's Scribbles\" is a delightful and humorous graphic novel that perfectly aligns with my love for light, relatable, and entertaining reads. The book's short format is a minor drawback, as I found myself wanting more of Sarah Andersen's creative and amusing content. The illustrations are charming and the humor hits just the right spots, making it a refreshing and enjoyable read. While not as in-depth as some of my other favorites, it's a perfect pick-me-up and a great addition to any comic or graphic novel collection."
