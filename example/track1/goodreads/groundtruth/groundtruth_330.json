  "review": "\"Pashmina is a beautifully illustrated graphic novel that explores the themes of identity and heritage through the eyes of Priyanka Das. The magical element of the pashmina that transports Pri to India is a unique and engaging narrative device. While the story has moments of emotional depth, it also maintains a light and hopeful tone, making it a delightful read.\""
