  "review": "\"When Did You See Her Last?\" is a delightful continuation of Lemony Snicket's 'All The Wrong Questions' series. The book is filled with engaging mysteries and humor, which kept me thoroughly entertained. The quick and easy read is perfect for a cozy afternoon, and the characters are unique and well-crafted. While the plot occasionally slows down, the overall experience is enjoyable and consistent with the series' witty and mysterious tone. I particularly appreciated the noir elements and the clever writing style that Snicket is known for. A solid read that I would recommend to fans of the genre.\""
