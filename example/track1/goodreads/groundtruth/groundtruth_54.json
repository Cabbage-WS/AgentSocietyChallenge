  "review": "I found \"When Did You See Her Last?\" to be a delightful continuation of Lemony Snicket's All The Wrong Questions series. The mystery is cleverly woven into the quirky town of Stain'd-by-the-Sea, and the narrative maintains the signature Snicket wit and intrigue. A must-read for fans of the genre and newcomers alike."
