  "review": "\"I found 'Death of Dracula' to be an intriguing read, with a compelling storyline that pits Dracula's sons against each other in a battle for control. The artwork is visually engaging, and the plot moves at a brisk pace. However, the character development felt a bit shallow, and I wished for more depth in exploring the motivations of Xarus and Janus.\""
