  "review": "\"Tr\u00edada. Predestinaci\u00f3n 2\" continues the compelling story of the hybrid characters in the Memorias de Idh\u00fan series. The blend of action, suspense, and character development keeps the reader engaged, and the comic format enhances the visual storytelling. While not perfect, it's a solid addition to the series that I enjoyed reading."
