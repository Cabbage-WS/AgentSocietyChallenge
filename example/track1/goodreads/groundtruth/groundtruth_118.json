  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Strobe Edge, Vol. 6\" is a compelling addition to the series, offering a well-developed cast of characters and a thickening plot that keeps the reader engaged. The relationships, particularly between Ninako and Ren, are nuanced and realistic, avoiding clich\u00e9s. The Valentine's Day and bonus chapters, like 'Colorless Dreamer,' add depth and fun to the narrative. However, the love triangle trope, while handled well, is something I generally find overused. Overall, it's a solid read that aligns with my preferences for engaging and well-illustrated stories, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of a perfect 5.0."
