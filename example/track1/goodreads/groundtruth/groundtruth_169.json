  "review": "\"Sleeping\" is a sweet and gentle picture book, perfect for engaging infants and young children with its simple, repetitive text and soft illustrations. However, it lacks the depth and originality that I typically look for in children's literature. The pacing is slow, and there isn't much of a plot to keep older children interested. The book would benefit from being formatted as a board book to ensure durability for frequent handling. While it's a nice addition to a baby's library, it doesn't stand out as a must-read."
