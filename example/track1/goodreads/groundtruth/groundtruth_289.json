  "review": "\"Ania ze Zotego Brzegu\" is a charming addition to the Anne of Green Gables series, though it didn't quite resonate with me as much as the earlier books. I have a deep affection for the series, especially the way it captures Anne's growth and the relatability of her experiences. However, this installment, which focuses on Anne as a married woman with children, felt a bit disconnected from my current life stage. Despite this, the book still offers a nostalgic and engaging read, with Anne's character as well-developed and endearing as ever. The pacing was a bit slow for me, but I appreciate the timeless quality of the story and look forward to revisiting it in the future."
