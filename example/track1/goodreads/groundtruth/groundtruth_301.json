  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Tom Sawyer Abroad\" is a disappointing read, especially when compared to Twain's more celebrated works. While the premise of a parody of Jules Verne-style adventures is intriguing, the execution falls flat. The story lacks the depth and nuance found in \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" and the humor feels forced and rushed. The characters, while familiar, don't evolve or offer new insights, making the narrative feel superficial and uninspired. Despite the potential for a unique blend of adventure and satire, the book fails to deliver, and it's clear that it was perhaps written more for financial gain than artistic merit."
