  "review": "\"Over the River and Through the Wood\" is a charming book, especially for its old-fashioned watercolor illustrations that beautifully capture the essence of a traditional Thanksgiving. While it aligns with my interest in children's literature and its ability to convey life lessons, I found the narrative a bit simple and less engaging compared to the fast-paced and character-driven stories I typically enjoy. The book is well-suited for young readers and families looking for a gentle, nostalgic read during the holiday season. However, it didn't quite meet my expectations for strong character development and a more dynamic storyline."
