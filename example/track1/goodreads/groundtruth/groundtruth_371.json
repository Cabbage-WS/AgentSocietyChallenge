  "review": "\"El increible viaje de Ulises/ Ulysses Incredible Trip\" is a visually captivating retelling of Homer\u2019s epic, perfect for those who enjoy a blend of classic literature and modern graphic art. The illustrations are bold and reminiscent of ancient Greek art, which adds a unique layer to the narrative. The story captures the essence of Ulysses' journey with engaging and concise storytelling, making it accessible to a broader audience. However, the extensive use of red might be overwhelming for some, and the book's suitability for adults rather than children is a point to consider. Overall, it's a compelling and beautifully illustrated adaptation that aligns well with my preferences for graphic novels and educational, mythological content."
