  "review": "\"We Kill Monsters, Volume 1\" offers an intriguing premise with auto repair shop owners turned monster hunters. The artwork is engaging, and the story has potential, but the plot felt a bit uneven at times, and the character development could be stronger. It's a decent start to the series, but it didn't quite meet my expectations."
