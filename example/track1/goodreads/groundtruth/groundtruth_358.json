  "review": "\"Amsterdam\" is a children's book that takes a playful and educational approach to exploring the city. However, as someone who enjoys intense, violent manga and stories with strong, intriguing concepts, this book did not align with my preferences. The simple storyline and lack of depth in character development and plot complexity did not engage me. While it may be suitable for younger readers, it did not satisfy my craving for more complex and intense narratives."
