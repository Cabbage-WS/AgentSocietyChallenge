  "review": "\"Steal Moon, Volume 02\" is an intriguing blend of sci-fi and Egyptian mythology, which adds a unique twist to the narrative. The character dynamics, especially the evolving relationship between Nozomi and Coyote, were engaging and well-developed. However, the plot felt somewhat far-fetched at times, and the ending was a bit abrupt, leaving me wanting more resolution. While the artwork is appealing and the story has its moments, it didn't quite resonate with me as deeply as I had hoped. Still, it's a solid read for fans of the genre."
