  "review": "\"Detective School Q Vol. 1\" is a delightful start to what promises to be an engaging series. The premise of a school for aspiring detectives is unique and intriguing, and the characters introduced are each distinct and interesting in their own way. I particularly enjoyed the blend of mystery and school life, which kept me hooked throughout the read."
