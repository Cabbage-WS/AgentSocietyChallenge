  "review": "\"Alice in the Country of Hearts, Vol. 04\" is a delightful continuation of this whimsical and darkly enchanting series. The manga's unique take on Wonderland, with its intricate world-building and evolving characters, kept me thoroughly engaged. The balance of humor and deeper, emotional moments, such as the Jet Coaster Coffee Cup and Alice's internal struggles, struck a perfect chord. While I wished for a bit more depth in some character motivations, the overall narrative and visual storytelling are top-notch. This volume definitely meets my craving for fantastical tales with a touch of darkness and emotional depth. I'm eager to see where the story goes next!\""
