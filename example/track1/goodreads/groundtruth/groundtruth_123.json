  "review": "\"The Lessons\" by Joanne Diaz is a captivating collection of poetry that resonates with a deep passion for natural history and the intricate interplay of science and human emotion. The rhythmic and vivid descriptions draw you into a world where longing and love are explored in their most profound forms. It's a beautiful debut, though at times the complexity of the themes can be challenging, making it a rewarding yet thoughtful read."
