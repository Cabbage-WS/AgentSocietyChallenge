  "review": "\"Is a Door\" is a poetic exploration that resonates with its unique use of language and cultural depth. The fragmented style and abstract content, while artistically rich, sometimes made it challenging to fully engage with the narrative. The book's focus on racialized otherness and the concept of 'between-ness' is intriguing, but the lack of a clear thematic coherence and the abstract nature of the poems occasionally felt disjointed. Despite these challenges, the book's emotional resonance and linguistic mindfulness offer a thought-provoking read, though it may not fully satisfy those looking for a more structured and linear experience."
