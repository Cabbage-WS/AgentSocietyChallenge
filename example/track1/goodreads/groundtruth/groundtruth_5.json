  "review": "\"Ruth Padel's selection of Sir Walter Ralegh's poetry, along with those of his contemporaries, provides a captivating glimpse into the Renaissance era. The prefaces not only enrich the understanding of the poems but also offer a personal touch that resonates with the reader. It's a delightful read for anyone interested in classic poetry and the literary landscape of early modern England.\""
