  "review": "\"Poems\" by Sir Walter Ralegh, introduced by Ruth Padel, is a collection that, while historically significant, did not resonate with me. As someone who enjoys the humor and whimsy of Roald Dahl and the intricate world-building of dystopian fiction, I found this collection somewhat dry and lacking in emotional depth. The poems, while beautifully crafted, did not engage me on the level I expect from literature. The introduction by Padel provided some context, but it wasn't enough to make the poems come alive for me. I appreciate the historical value, but it didn't meet my personal standards for storytelling and character development."
