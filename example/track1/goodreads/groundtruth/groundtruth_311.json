  "review": "\"Night of the Living Dummy 3\" is a delightful read that brings the classic Goosebumps series to life with its eerie and engaging plot. The story of the dummies coming to life and causing chaos is both thrilling and suspenseful, making it a perfect choice for fans of R.L. Stine's work or anyone who enjoys a good scare. While it's aimed at a younger audience, the clever writing and unexpected twists kept me hooked until the last page."
