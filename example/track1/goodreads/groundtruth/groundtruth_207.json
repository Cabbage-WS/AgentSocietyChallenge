  "review": "\"The Wrong Side of Magic\" is a delightful and whimsical adventure that perfectly captures the essence of a magical world ruled by words, thoughts, and memories. Hudson's journey from disbelief to wonder is engaging and relatable, and the introduction of quirky characters like snarky unicorns and helpful fairies adds a humorous and charming touch. While the plot is slightly predictable at times, the book's creativity and light-hearted tone make it a joy to read, especially for those who enjoy a mix of humor and fantasy. It's a book that would appeal to both children and adults who appreciate a good, fun story with a touch of magic."
