  "review": "\"The 'Divine Comedy' by Dante, with its rich historical and cultural background, initially piqued my interest. However, while the Gustave Dor\u00e9 illustrations are indeed stunning and enhance the reading experience, the narrative's pacing and style did not fully align with my preferences. The epic poem is a significant work, but the dense, archaic language and religious themes sometimes detracted from its impact, making it feel less engaging than the fast-paced, realistic storytelling I usually enjoy. The physical size and weight of the book also made it cumbersome to read, which further affected my overall experience.\""
