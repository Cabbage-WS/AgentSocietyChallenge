  "review": "\"101 Famous Poems\" is a collection that resonates with my appreciation for classic literature and strong character arcs, but it also has its shortcomings. The anthology includes timeless works by renowned poets like Longfellow, Whitman, and Wordsworth, which I found deeply moving and well-crafted. However, the collection is heavily skewed towards male authors and older, more traditional pieces, which can feel a bit disengaging and out of touch with modern sensibilities. While I enjoyed the depth and variety of themes, some poems felt overly sentimental and difficult to connect with. Overall, it's a valuable addition to any classic literature enthusiast's shelf, but it might not fully satisfy those looking for more contemporary or diverse voices.\""
