  "review": "\"Edgar Allan Poe's 'Annabel Lee' is a haunting and beautifully written poem that captures the essence of love and loss. The language is evocative, and the story of the young lovers is both tragic and timeless. While it's a short read, it leaves a lasting impression, making it a must-read for anyone who appreciates the depth and emotion of classic poetry.\""
