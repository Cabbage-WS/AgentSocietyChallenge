  "review": "\"Diving into the complete poems of Alberto Caeiro, a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa, was a profound experience. The simplicity and directness of his verses, which often reflect a deep connection with nature, resonate with a universal truth that is both compelling and soothing. I found myself returning to these poems multiple times, each reading revealing new layers of meaning and beauty.\""
