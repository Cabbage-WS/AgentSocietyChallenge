  "review": "\"Little House in Brookfield\" is a brief and abridged introduction to the life of Caroline Ingalls, but it falls short of my expectations. The content, barely over 100 pages, feels rushed and lacks the depth and detail I appreciate in historical fiction, especially when it comes to the lives of historical figures. While the book provides a glimpse into Caroline's daily life, it misses the mark in fully engaging the reader and capturing the essence of the time period. The abridged format also makes it difficult to find the original, uncondensed version, which is a significant drawback for someone interested in a more comprehensive story. Despite some engaging moments, the generic elements and brevity of the book make it a disappointment."
