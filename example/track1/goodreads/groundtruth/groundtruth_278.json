  "review": "This book felt like a mix of familiar and new, which was both intriguing and a bit disorienting. The illustrations were beautiful, and the story had a certain charm, reminiscent of my childhood favorites. However, the pacing was a bit slow, and the characters didn't resonate with me as much as I hoped. While it offered some deep insights, it didn\u2019t fully capture my imagination like \"Peter Pan\" or other classics I adore. It\u2019s a decent read, but it didn\u2019t quite meet my expectations."
