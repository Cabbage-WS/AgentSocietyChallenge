  "review": "This book of poetry offers a unique glimpse into the 20th-century Iranian literary scene, translated with care. The verses are evocative and thought-provoking, though the translation sometimes loses the nuances of the original language. It's a worthwhile read for those interested in exploring Persian poetry."
