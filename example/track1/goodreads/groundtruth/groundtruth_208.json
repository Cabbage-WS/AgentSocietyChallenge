  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Tokyo Gul 12. Cilt\" is a compelling addition to the series, offering well-developed character arcs and intriguing plot developments. The deepening of KHB's and Kaneki's personal journeys, along with the introduction of Rize and the unfolding of Yosimura's past, keeps the narrative engaging and emotionally resonant. While some post-battle sections felt stagnant, and the absence of beloved characters like Touka and Kaneki together was a minor disappointment, the book successfully sets the stage for an exciting climax. The balance of action and character development aligns well with my preference for depth and emotional complexity."
