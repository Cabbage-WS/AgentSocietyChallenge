  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Bosley Sees the World\" is a charming and engaging story that aligns well with my preference for books that explore themes of identity and cultural exploration, albeit in a simplified form for young children. The dual language format is a clever and effective tool for teaching Italian, and the color-coded key words make it accessible for both children and adults. The illustrations are vivid and complement the story nicely, making it a delightful read. While it might pose a slight challenge for beginners, the overall experience is positive, and the story's message of curiosity and adventure resonates well. However, it doesn't quite reach the level of depth I enjoy in more complex literature, which is why I'm giving it a solid 4.0."
