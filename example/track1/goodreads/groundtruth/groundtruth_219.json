  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Kindergarten, Here I Come!\" is a charming and well-illustrated book that serves its purpose of preparing young children for their first day of school. However, as someone who prefers dystopian and graphic novels, this book doesn't align with my usual tastes. The pacing is slow and predictable, and the characters, while sweet, lack the depth and complexity I enjoy in my reading. While it's a good tool for parents and educators, it doesn't resonate with my personal preferences."
