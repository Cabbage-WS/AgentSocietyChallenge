  "review": "\"Gone-Away Lake\" by Elizabeth Enright is a charming and nostalgic read that captures the essence of childhood adventure and the magic of discovery. The vivid descriptions of the overgrown, forgotten lake and the old houses create a captivating setting that draws you in. It's a delightful story that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys heartwarming tales of young explorers."
