  "review": "\"Ghostbusters International #4\" offers a nostalgic trip for fans of the original film, which is a plus. However, the comic doesn't delve deeply into complex personal or social issues, which I typically appreciate. The artwork is solid, and the characters are recognizable, but the pacing felt a bit slow, and the story didn't offer much new or challenging content. It's a fun read, but it doesn't resonate as strongly with my preferences for deeper themes and more dynamic character development."
