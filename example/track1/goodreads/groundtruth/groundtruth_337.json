  "review": "\"The Mystery at Lilac Inn\" offers a classic Nancy Drew experience, filled with suspense and a resourceful protagonist. While the plot is engaging and the characters are charming, the story felt a bit predictable and occasionally unrealistic, which detracted from my enjoyment. The writing style is dated but still captures the spirit of the series, making it a nostalgic and enjoyable read, especially for younger audiences. Overall, it's a solid entry in the Nancy Drew series, though it might not fully resonate with more mature readers."
