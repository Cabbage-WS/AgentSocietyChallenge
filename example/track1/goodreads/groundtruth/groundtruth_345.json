  "review": "\"The Red Cloak\" is a captivating retelling of an old Scottish ballad that resonates deeply with my love for culturally rich and fantastical stories. The narrative, centered around Jan's determination to rescue her friend Tam from the elves, is both enchanting and inspiring. The wise old woman and the magical red cloak add layers of depth and wonder, making this book a delightful read for all ages. The illustrations and the concise yet engaging storytelling make it a perfect addition to any collection of folklore and myth-inspired tales. Highly recommended!\""
