  "review": "\"Where's Rodney?\" is a delightful picture book that captures the essence of a child's adventurous spirit and the transformative power of nature. Rodney's journey from a confined, mundane environment to the vibrant, open space of a park is both heartwarming and inspiring. The illustrations are vibrant and complement the story well, making it a great read for young children and a reminder of the importance of outdoor play."
