  "review": "\"Someone's Come to Our House\" is a children's book that didn't quite resonate with me. While the illustrations are bright and celebratory, the repetitive phrases and overall tone felt a bit forced, which didn't sit well with my preference for more meaningful and thought-provoking stories. The book's attempt to create a celebratory atmosphere for a new baby's arrival was well-intentioned, but the execution lacked the depth and originality I usually appreciate in my reads. The repetitive \"Hey, hey, bless-a-my-soul!\" was particularly grating and detracted from the experience. While it might appeal to fans of Cynthia Rylant, it didn't align with my tastes."
