  "review": "\"Ichiro\" is a beautifully crafted graphic novel that resonates deeply with my love for diverse and inclusive themes, especially those that blend mythology with contemporary storytelling. The protagonist, Ichiro, is well-developed, and his journey of self-discovery is both heartfelt and relatable. The artwork, particularly the sumi style, is stunning and perfectly complements the story's tone. However, the narrative structure felt a bit disjointed, and the transition to the mythological realm was somewhat abrupt. Despite these minor issues, the book's exploration of cultural identity and family relationships made it a compelling read."
