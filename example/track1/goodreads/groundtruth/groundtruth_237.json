  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Moon Dance (Sparkle Books)\" seems to be a children's book, which is a bit outside my usual reading preferences, which tend to lean towards fantasy and contemporary poetry. The lack of detailed reviews and specific content makes it challenging to fully appreciate the book's strengths. However, the themes of ocean and night, as well as the rhyming and artistic elements, do have some appeal. While it didn't resonate with me as much as \"Harry Potter\" or \"The Dogs I Have Kissed,\" it still has its charm and could be a fun read for the right audience."
