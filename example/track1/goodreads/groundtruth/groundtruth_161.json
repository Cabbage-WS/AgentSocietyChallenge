  "review": "\"Children on the Oregon Trail\" is a compelling and historically rich narrative that captures the resilience and strength of the Sager children. However, the plot's reliance on unrealistic survival scenarios, such as a dog killing a grizzly bear, detracts from the overall believability. While the characters are endearing and their journey is inspiring, the story sometimes feels more idealized than grounded in the harsh realities of the time. It's a good read, but it could have benefited from a more nuanced and realistic portrayal of the challenges they faced."
