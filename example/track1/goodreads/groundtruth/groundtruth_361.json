  "review": "\"La biblioth\u00e9caire\" is an interesting read that touches on the themes of mystery and the power of books, which are elements I usually enjoy. However, the tone and style of the book felt a bit too juvenile for its intended audience, which made it less engaging than I had hoped. While it successfully introduces children to literature and includes a heartwarming journey, the superficial treatment of characters and plot left me wanting more depth. It's a good book for younger readers, but it didn't quite resonate with me as much as I expected."
