  "review": "\"The Walking Dead, Issue #102\" is a solid entry in the series, but it doesn't quite hit the emotional and impactful notes that I typically look for in my reads. The issue delves into the aftermath of Negan's demands and the town's reaction, with Rick's leadership under scrutiny. While the plot moves forward and the characters' motivations are clear, the issue feels more like a stepping stone than a standout moment. The art is well-executed, and the pacing is steady, but it lacks the depth and resonance of the books I've rated 5 stars, which often leave a lasting emotional impact. It's a decent read, but not one that will stay with me for years to come."
