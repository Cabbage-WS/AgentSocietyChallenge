  "review": "\"Welcome Home, Mouse\" is a charming story that resonates with the importance of friendship and making amends. Stanley's enthusiasm leading to accidental destruction, followed by his creative and heartfelt efforts to rebuild Mouse's home, teaches a valuable lesson about responsibility and the joy of giving. Elisa Kleven's illustrations are as delightful as the narrative, making this a perfect read for young children."
