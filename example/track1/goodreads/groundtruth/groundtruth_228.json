  "review": "\"Red Is Best\" is a charming and whimsical children's book that captures the simple joys and obstinate preferences of a young child. While it doesn't align with my usual preferences for graphic novels and fantasy series, I appreciated the creativity and relatability of Kelly's love for the color red. The illustrations by Robin Baird Lewis are delightful and bring the story to life with a child's perspective. However, as someone who values intricate world-building and complex character arcs, this book felt a bit too simplistic for my tastes. It's a sweet and timeless tale, but it may not resonate as strongly with older readers or those looking for more depth. Still, it's a great choice for young children and anyone who enjoys a light, engaging read."
