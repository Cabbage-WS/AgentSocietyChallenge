  "review": "\"V\u00e4kivaltainen tausta\" is a compelling read that aligns well with my interests in graphic novels and crime stories. The narrative is engaging and immersive, with a plot that keeps you guessing. The illustrations, while initially a bit rough, grow on you and effectively support the dark and intense story. The character development is solid, especially in how Tom McKenna's past catches up with him, making for a memorable and impactful narrative. The pacing is a bit uneven at times, but overall, it's a strong addition to the genre."
