  "review": "\"Original Sin\" is a visually stunning graphic novel with a concept that initially grabbed my attention. The murder of the Watcher and the subsequent cosmic manhunt are intriguing, and the artwork is exceptional, with detailed and dynamic visuals that bring the Marvel Universe to life. However, the plot execution felt somewhat disjointed and failed to live up to its ambitious premise. The story often drifted into less engaging territory, and the pacing was inconsistent, especially in the middle sections. While it offers some interesting character developments, particularly with Thor, the overall narrative didn't resonate as deeply as I had hoped. Despite these issues, it remains a solid entry in the Marvel canon, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of my favorite graphic novels."
