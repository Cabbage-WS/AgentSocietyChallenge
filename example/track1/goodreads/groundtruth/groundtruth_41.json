The protagonist, Igraine, is a standout character\u2014smart, brave, and relatable, which makes her journey all the more engaging. The story is well-paced and refreshingly original, with a plot that doesn't rely on predictable tropes. The charming black-and-white illustrations enhance the reading experience, making it a perfect choice for young readers. While the book doesn't delve deeply into complex moral issues, it still manages to convey important messages about courage and friendship in a way that is both fun and meaningful.
