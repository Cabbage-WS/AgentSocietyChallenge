  "review": "\"Where Do Diggers Sleep at Night?\" is a charming picture book that captures the bedtime routines of construction vehicles, which will likely appeal to children who are passionate about trucks. However, the book feels somewhat derivative, and the rhyming scheme doesn't always flow smoothly. While the anthropomorphized trucks add a cute touch, they don't resonate as deeply as I hoped. It's a solid addition to a child's bedtime story collection, but it lacks the linguistic richness and originality that I typically look for in my reads.\""
