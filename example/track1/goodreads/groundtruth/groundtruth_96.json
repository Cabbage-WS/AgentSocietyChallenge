  "review": "\"Afke's Tiental\" provides a poignant glimpse into the life of a large family struggling in rural Friesland. The story is touching and the characters are well-drawn, but the narrative sometimes feels a bit slow and repetitive, which can make it challenging to maintain engagement throughout the book. Nevertheless, it's a heartfelt and authentic portrayal of a bygone era."
