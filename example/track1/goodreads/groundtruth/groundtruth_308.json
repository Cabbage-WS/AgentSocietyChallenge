  "review": "\"Jeremy Schmal & The Cult of Comfort\" offers a unique blend of poetry and narrative that is both thought-provoking and engaging. The author's style is distinctive, and the themes of comfort and discomfort are explored in a way that resonates on a personal level. While it might not be everyone's cup of tea, I found it to be a refreshing read that left me thinking long after I finished the last page."
