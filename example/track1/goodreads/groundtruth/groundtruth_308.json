  "review": "\"My Friend Dahmer\" is a graphic novel that delves into the high school years of Jeffrey Dahmer, a notorious serial killer. While the illustrations are well-executed and the personal perspective is unique, the subject matter is deeply unsettling and conflicts with my preference for stories that offer solace and positive themes. The book's exploration of dark and disturbing content, while historically accurate, does not align with my interest in emotionally touching and uplifting narratives. The subjective nature of the story also left me questioning its completeness and balance. Despite its critical acclaim, I found it difficult to connect with the characters or find any redeeming qualities in the narrative, making it a challenging and less enjoyable read for me."
