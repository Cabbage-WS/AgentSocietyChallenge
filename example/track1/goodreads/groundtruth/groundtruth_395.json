  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"The Last Guru\" is a compelling and humorous exploration of themes such as fame, fortune, and the absurdity of religious fads. While the book's depth and re-readability are commendable, the pacing and some of the humor might not resonate as strongly with younger readers. The plot is engaging and original, but it occasionally feels a bit slow, which is a minor drawback for someone who values fast-paced narratives. Nonetheless, it's a delightful read that offers a lot to think about."
