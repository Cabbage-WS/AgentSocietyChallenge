  "review": "\"18\" is an intriguing manga that delves into complex themes and character development. While the plot has some engaging moments, particularly with the character evolution of Esther, the pacing and writing style didn't fully captivate me. The story's premise and the visual art are appealing, but I found the narrative a bit slow and the character arcs less compelling than I had hoped. It's a decent read, but it didn't resonate as strongly as some of my other favorites in the adventure and coming-of-age genres."
