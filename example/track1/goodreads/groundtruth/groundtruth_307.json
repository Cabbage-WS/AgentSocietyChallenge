  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Just a Kite\" by Mercer Mayer is a charming and accessible book for young readers, with a simple narrative and relatable characters. However, it doesn't quite align with my preference for deeply reflective stories or those that evoke a strong sense of nostalgia. The plot is straightforward and engaging, but the message of consumerism and the lack of character ingenuity are aspects that I find less appealing. While the familial bonding and the support from Grandpa are positive, the book feels more like a light read rather than a profound literary experience. It's a decent choice for early readers but doesn't resonate with my usual tastes."
