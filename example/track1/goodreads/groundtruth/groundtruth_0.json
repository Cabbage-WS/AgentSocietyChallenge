  "review": "\"In the Spotlight\" is a charming and engaging book that will likely appeal to young ballet enthusiasts. The story is well-suited for its target audience, offering a glimpse into the world of dance with relatable characters and a touch of excitement. However, as someone who particularly enjoys rich, imaginative settings and strong character development, I found the book a bit light on depth and originality. It\u2019s a cute read, but it doesn\u2019t quite capture the boundless imagination and zest for life that I typically look for in my favorite books. Still, it\u2019s a solid choice for budding ballerinas."
