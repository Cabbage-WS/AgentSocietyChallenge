  "review": "\"Common Carnage\" is a mixed bag that ultimately didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped. While there are some standout poems like \"Winter Nights\" and \"Lullaby\" that are beautifully written and emotionally resonant, the overall collection feels uneven. The thematic thread about Achilles seems tacked on and doesn't integrate well with the rest of the content. The poems that attempt to tackle big questions of human life often come across as superficial, which was a disappointment. Given my preference for strong character development and engaging plot twists, I found the lack of depth and consistency in this collection to be a significant drawback."
