  "review": "\"El libro sin dibujos\" is a delightful and humorous read that aligns well with my love for children's literature and heartwarming stories. The book's unique concept of forcing the reader to say silly things out loud is both clever and engaging, making it perfect for reading aloud to children. While it doesn't have the deep moral lessons of some of my favorite classics, it excels in creating a fun and interactive experience that brings laughter and joy to both kids and adults. The lack of illustrations might seem like a drawback, but it turns out to be a charming feature that encourages creativity and imagination. Overall, it's a book that I would gladly share with my children and recommend to others looking for a light-hearted, entertaining read."
