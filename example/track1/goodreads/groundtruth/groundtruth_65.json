  "review": "\"El libro sin dibujos\" is a delightful and inventive read that challenges the conventional format of a picture book. It cleverly engages the reader, especially children, by encouraging them to participate in the storytelling process, making it both interactive and humorous. While it might seem simple, the book's ability to provoke laughter and spark creativity is truly impressive."
