  "review": "\"Folly\" by Nada Gordon is a delightful and challenging read that resonates with my appreciation for poetry that pushes boundaries. The book's unique blend of linguistic brilliance and a wide-ranging, inclusive scope is both refreshing and invigorating. Gordon's ability to weave together diverse themes and references, from the mythological to the contemporary, creates a rich tapestry that is intellectually stimulating. While the fragmented structure and density might be a hurdle for some, I found it to be a rewarding experience that kept me engaged and eager to uncover new layers of meaning. This book is a testament to the power of poetry to explore the human condition in all its complexity and beauty."
