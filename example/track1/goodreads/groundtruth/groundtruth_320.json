  "review": "\"The Dragon's Toothache\" is a delightful and whimsical story that captures the imagination with its unique premise and charming characters. Annie Besant\u2019s witty narrative, paired with Rayika Sen\u2019s vibrant illustrations, brings the tale to life, making it a perfect read for children and adults alike. The book\u2019s message of cooperation and empathy resonates strongly, adding depth to its playful narrative."
