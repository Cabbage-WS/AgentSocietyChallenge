  "review": "\"Stoneheart\" is a charming and sweet book that resonates with the power of love and the importance of feeling valued. The story is engaging and the message is beautifully delivered, making it a great choice for bedtime stories or educational use. While it doesn't have the whimsical humor of Catbug, the book's warmth and simplicity are endearing. It's a lovely addition to any children's bookshelf, perfect for sharing with young ones."
