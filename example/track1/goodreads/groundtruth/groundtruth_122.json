  "review": "\"Monster Truck Mater [With 3-D Glasses]\" is a short, visually engaging book that might appeal to young children, but it didn't resonate with me. As someone who enjoys humor, relatable content, and autobiographical elements, this book felt too simplistic and lacked the depth I appreciate. The 3-D glasses were a fun touch, but the story itself was underdeveloped, and the characters didn't have the same charm as in the movie. While the visuals were appealing, the lack of substance and personal connection made it hard to enjoy fully. I prefer books that offer more depth and a sense of personal growth, which this book didn't provide."
