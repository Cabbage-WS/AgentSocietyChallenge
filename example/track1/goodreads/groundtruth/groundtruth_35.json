  "review": "\"Zetman #18\" continues the intense and action-packed narrative of the series. Jin's transformation and the subsequent loss of control add a layer of suspense, while Kouga's return to combat in an incomplete Alphas suit introduces new challenges and mysteries. The story maintains its momentum, though some plot points could be more clearly developed."
