  "review": "\"Ed the Happy Clown\" by Chester Brown is a fascinating start to his graphic novel series. The artwork is distinct and engaging, drawing you into the surreal and sometimes unsettling world of Ed. Despite its serialized format, the first issue packs a powerful punch, leaving me eager to read on and see where this story goes."
