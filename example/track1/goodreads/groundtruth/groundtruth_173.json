  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Seven to Eternity #9\" is a comic that, while praised by many for its vivid world-building and political intrigue, doesn't quite align with my usual reading preferences. As someone who enjoys children's literature and fantasy with a focus on Santa Claus and magical creatures, the political and action-packed themes of this book feel out of place. The artwork, while detailed and well-executed, doesn't resonate with the kind of stories and characters I typically find engaging. While I appreciate the effort and creativity put into the series, it doesn't capture my interest in the same way that more child-friendly and morally focused stories do."
