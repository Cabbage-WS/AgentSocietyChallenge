  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Pink Panther #1\" brings back a classic character with a mix of silent and thought-filled strips, which is a nice touch. However, as someone who enjoys more narrative-driven stories, especially those involving adventure and the natural world, I found the comic a bit light on depth. The side cartoons, particularly the anteater, add charm, but the overall experience didn't resonate with me as much as I hoped. It's a fun read, but not a standout."
