  "review": "\"A Song for the Thea Sisters\" is an engaging and well-illustrated graphic novel that will likely appeal to its intended audience of middle-grade readers. The story's focus on a band competition and the themes of teamwork and overcoming obstacles are commendable. However, as someone who values character depth and unique storytelling, I found the characters a bit one-dimensional and the plot somewhat predictable. While the visuals are appealing, the story didn't quite resonate with me on a deeper level. It's a solid read, but it doesn't quite hit the mark for my personal preferences."
