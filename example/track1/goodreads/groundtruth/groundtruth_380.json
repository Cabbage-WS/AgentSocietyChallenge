  "review": "\"The More Difficult Beauty\" by Molly Fisk is a profound and engaging collection of poetry that resonates on multiple levels. The vivid imagery and precision-driven word choices make deeply personal moments feel universal, much like the unique and relatable characters in the children's literature I enjoy. Fisk's exploration of complex themes such as love, death, and aging is both fearless and candid, with a touch of whimsy that keeps the poems accessible and moving. The book's ability to balance the difficult with the ebullient is a testament to Fisk's skill as a poet, making it a delightful and thought-provoking read."
