  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Um sakne springe blome\" is a beautifully written and lyrical book that immerses the reader in a dark, mythic world. The unique language and poetic style are reminiscent of ancient Norse and Norwegian dialects, creating a haunting and evocative atmosphere. While I appreciated the artistic and literary merit of the book, the slow pacing and dense, sometimes obscure prose made it a challenging read. This book is certainly not for everyone, and while it didn't fully resonate with my preferences, I can still admire its craftsmanship and the depth of its storytelling."
