  "review": "\"Flash 02\" is an interesting continuation of the Flash's story in the new DC universe, but it doesn't quite live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. The pacing feels a bit sluggish, and the momentum from the Flashpoint event is not fully sustained. While the characters remain engaging, the plot lacks the same level of impact and excitement. It's still a decent read, but it falls short of being a standout issue."
