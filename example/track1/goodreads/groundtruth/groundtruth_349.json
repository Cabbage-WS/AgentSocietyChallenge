  "stars": 3.0,
  "review": "\"Paper Heart\" touches on themes of overprotective parenting and a child's struggle for independence, which are certainly relevant and well-executed. However, the pacing is slow, and the writing style is overly simplistic, which detracts from the narrative's impact. The unexpected plot twist adds a layer of interest, but it doesn't fully compensate for the lack of depth and engagement in the earlier parts of the book. While the protagonist's journey is relatable, the overall execution falls short of my expectations for character development and emotional depth."
