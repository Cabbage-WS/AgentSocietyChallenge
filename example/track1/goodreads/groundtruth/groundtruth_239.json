  "review": "\"Batman Beyond (2016-) #7\" didn't quite hit the mark for me. While I appreciate the historical and futuristic elements, the issue felt shallow and lacked the depth I enjoy in stories. The final panel was intriguing but left me wanting more, especially concerning the suit. The pacing felt rushed, and the characters didn't have enough time to develop, which is a significant miss for me. I prefer stories with strong character arcs and immersive world-building, and this issue didn't quite deliver."
