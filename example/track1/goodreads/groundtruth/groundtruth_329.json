  "review": "\"Cinnamon\" is a beautifully illustrated children's book, but it just didn't resonate with me. The story of a princess who doesn't speak and a tiger who tries to change her felt a bit too simplistic and lacked the emotional depth I usually look for in my reading. While the artwork is stunning, the narrative didn't offer the kind of comfort or relatability I've come to appreciate in books. It's a good book, but it just wasn't for me."
