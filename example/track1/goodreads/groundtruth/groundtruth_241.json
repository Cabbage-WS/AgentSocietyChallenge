  "review": "\"Sabrina the Teenage Witch #38\" is a delightful addition to the series, packed with fun and charm. While it doesn't delve deeply into emotional themes or have a strong focus on pets, which I usually love, the book is still a joy to read. The characters are engaging, and the magical elements are well-executed, making it a quick and entertaining read. It's perfect for fans of lighthearted fantasy and comics, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying the story despite it not hitting all my usual sweet spots."
