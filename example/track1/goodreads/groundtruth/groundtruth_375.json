  "review": "\"This Hotel Is Haunted!\" is a fun and engaging read for younger audiences, with its colorful illustrations and playful language. The story of Geronimo Stilton and Hercule Poirat investigating a haunted hotel is light-hearted and entertaining, making it a good choice for those looking for a quick, enjoyable read. However, the plot resolves a bit too quickly, and the humor might not appeal to older readers. While it's not my top pick, it's a solid choice for kids who enjoy mystery and adventure with a dash of humor."
