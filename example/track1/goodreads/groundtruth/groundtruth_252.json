  "review": "\"En la Vida Real\" is a visually stunning graphic novel that resonates with its exploration of online gaming and the real-world implications of virtual actions. Amanda's journey is engaging, and the artwork is a delight. However, while the book tackles complex social issues, it sometimes feels too brief and superficial, not delving deeply enough into the nuanced dynamics it introduces. Despite this, it remains a thought-provoking read that challenges the reader to consider the broader impact of their digital lives."
