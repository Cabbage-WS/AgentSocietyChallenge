  "review": "\"Midnight\" is a beautifully illustrated and engaging book that captures the essence of a significant moment in history. The story of Lieutenant Guy Haydon and his mare, Midnight, is both touching and educational, making it a perfect read for those interested in the ANZAC legacy and the role of horses in warfare. While it doesn't delve into the intricacies of poetry, which I typically enjoy, the narrative is well-crafted and suitable for a wide audience, including young readers. The book's ability to foster empathy and understanding of historical events is commendable, and it serves as an excellent resource for educational settings. However, I would have appreciated a bit more depth in the character development, especially for those who are new to the historical context. Overall, a worthy addition to any collection on World War I and its impact.\""
