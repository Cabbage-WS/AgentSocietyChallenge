  "review": "\"Counting Colors\" is a delightful and educational picture book that effectively teaches young children about colors, counting, and finding hidden objects. The large format and vibrant illustrations make it engaging for toddlers and preschoolers. It\u2019s a perfect addition to any early learning collection, and I appreciate how it combines learning with fun in a simple, yet effective way."
