  "review": "\"Abby and the Mystery Baby\" did not live up to my expectations, especially considering my preference for strong character development and engaging plots. The story felt predictable and contrived, with the mystery's resolution being unsatisfactory. The plot raised many questions but failed to provide a satisfying conclusion, leaving me frustrated and unfulfilled. While the premise had potential, the execution fell short, and the book missed an opportunity to explore deeper themes."
