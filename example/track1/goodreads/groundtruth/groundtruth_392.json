  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Panicle\" by Gillian Sze is a thought-provoking collection that challenges the reader's perception of the act of seeing, blending poetic responses to film theory with lyrical explorations of still images. The depth of Sze's work, particularly in the section \"Guillemets,\" showcases her skill in translating visual art into poignant verse. A compelling read for those interested in the intersection of poetry and visual arts."
