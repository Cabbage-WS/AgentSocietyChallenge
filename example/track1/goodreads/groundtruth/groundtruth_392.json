  "stars": 4.0,
  "review": "\"Elemental Gelade, Volume 3\" is a solid addition to the series, with well-developed characters and an engaging storyline that continues to evolve. Cisqua's development is particularly noteworthy, adding depth to her role and making her a more compelling character. The art is visually appealing, which enhances the overall reading experience. While the story uses some common tropes, it handles them in a fresh and unique way, keeping the narrative interesting. However, it didn't quite reach the emotional depth I've come to appreciate in my favorite manga, such as 'Orange' and 'Anohana,' which is why I'm giving it a 4.0. Still, it's a fun and enjoyable read that I would recommend to fans of the genre."
