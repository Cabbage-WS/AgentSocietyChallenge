  "stars": 2.0,
  "review": "\"Scared Silly!\" is a mixed bag. While it offers a diverse collection of poems and stories by renowned authors, which could be valuable for educational purposes, it doesn't align with my preferences for deep, thought-provoking content. The book's focus on lighter, often humorous themes and its inclusion of potentially unsettling content, like 'I'm Coming Up the Stairs,' makes it less appealing. The illustrations are charming, but the overall tone and content are not what I typically enjoy in my reading."
