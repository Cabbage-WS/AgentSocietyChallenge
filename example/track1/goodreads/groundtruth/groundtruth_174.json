  "review": "\"Sleeping\" is a sweet and gentle book that captures the innocence of a child trying to get their father's attention. The wordless format allows the reader to interpret the emotions and actions of the characters through the illustrations, which are beautifully detailed and expressive. A charming addition to any children's book collection."
