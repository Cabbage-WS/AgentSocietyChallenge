  "review": "\"Afke's Tiental\" is a heartwarming family story set in a rural Dutch village, where the struggles of a large family are vividly portrayed. The detailed descriptions of daily life and the family's efforts to survive are both touching and insightful. However, the pacing can be slow at times, with overly detailed accounts of minor events, which may not appeal to readers looking for a more dynamic narrative. Despite this, the book offers a valuable glimpse into a different era and the resilience of the human spirit. While it doesn't fully capture the expressive and engaging characters I love in children's literature, it still has its moments of charm and historical significance."
