  "review": "\"The House at Pooh Corner\" is a delightful continuation of the adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh and friends. The stories are charmingly simple yet profound, capturing the essence of childhood and friendship. Peter Dennis\u2019s narration brings the characters to life, making it a joy to listen to, though I found the pacing a bit slow at times. Overall, it\u2019s a heartwarming addition to any collection of children's literature."
