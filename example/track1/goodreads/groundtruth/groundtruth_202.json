  "review": "\"Please, Baby, Please\" is a charming and relatable picture book that captures the essence of raising a mischievous toddler. The illustrations by Kadir Nelson are both beautiful and humorous, depicting the everyday antics of a rambunctious child in a way that will make parents nod in recognition. The rhyming text flows smoothly, making it a pleasure to read aloud. While the cadence could be slightly tighter, the overall experience is delightful and sure to entertain both children and adults. A wonderful addition to any family's bookshelf.\""
