  "review": "\"The Dragon's Toothache\" is a delightful and whimsical children\u2019s book that aligns well with my appreciation for stories that blend cultural elements with imaginative storytelling. The quirky humor of Annie Besant and the vibrant illustrations by Rayika Sen make this book a joy to read, especially for children. While it may not delve into the deep philosophical or existential themes I often enjoy, it excels in its educational and interactive approach, making it a perfect read for sparking conversations with young readers about problem-solving and dental hygiene. The book\u2019s engaging and uplifting tone ensures it can be enjoyed over and over again, which is a testament to its enduring charm."
