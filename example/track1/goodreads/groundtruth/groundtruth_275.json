  "review": "\"Pictograms From The Interior Of B.C\" is a beautifully crafted collection of poetry that resonates with its vivid imagery and emotional depth. The author's unique style captures the essence of nature and human experience, making it a compelling read. While the book may not offer the complex world-building found in graphic novels or the diverse character development I typically enjoy, it excels in its ability to evoke powerful emotions and paint a picture with words. The themes of nature and human connection are seamlessly interwoven, providing a reflective and engaging experience. However, the lack of a broader narrative or character arcs prevented it from earning a perfect score. Overall, a strong and poetic work that I found quite moving.\""
