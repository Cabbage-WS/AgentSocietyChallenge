  "review": "\"Annabel Lee\" by Edgar Allan Poe is a captivating and beautifully written poem that resonates with a profound sense of loss and undying love. The poem's intensity and the slight edge of creepiness add a unique depth, making it a memorable read. While it didn't leave as lasting an impression as some of my other favorite books, its emotional impact and poetic beauty are undeniable. Poe's mastery of language and his ability to evoke deep feelings are truly commendable. This poem is a must-read for anyone who appreciates classic literature and the power of poetic expression.\""
