  "review": "\"Marshmallow-Winter\" is a middle-grade novel that aligns with my interest in children's literature, particularly stories that explore themes of family, friendship, and coming-of-age. The book does a commendable job of weaving in multiple themes such as child welfare, environmental concerns, and the struggles of small-town life, which are presented in a mature and thoughtful manner. However, the sheer number of themes sometimes feels overwhelming, and the main character's maturity can seem out of place for her age. The inclusion of recipes, like the cinnamon toast, adds a unique and delightful touch, making the book stand out. Overall, it's a solid read, but it didn't quite reach the heights of my favorite children's books."
