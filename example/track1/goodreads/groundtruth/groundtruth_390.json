  "review": "\"The Dark Stairs\" by Herculeah Jones starts off with a promising premise, combining mystery and a strong, young female protagonist. However, the execution falls short of expectations. Herculeah's character is mean and sneaky, which makes it difficult to root for her. The mystery itself is unsatisfying, with the solution feeling overly simplistic and almost accidental. While the book attempts to engage young readers, the heavy themes and lack of attention to parental advice might not be appropriate for the intended audience. Overall, it's a disappointing read that doesn't align well with my preference for engaging and likable characters."
