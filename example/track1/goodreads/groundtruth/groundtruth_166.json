  "review": "I approached \"Howard Lovecraft FCBD 2016 Edition\" with high hopes, given my appreciation for Lovecraft's cosmic horror. Unfortunately, the comic adaptation felt rushed and lacked the depth and atmosphere that makes Lovecraft's work so compelling. The artwork was decent, but the story's brevity and the lack of character development left me unsatisfied."
