  "review": "\"The Far Mosque\" by Kazim Ali is a collection of poetry that explores deep spiritual and mystical themes, which I found both intriguing and challenging. While I usually enjoy children's literature and stories with a nostalgic, innocent feel, this book offers a very different experience. The poetry is intense and beautifully crafted, with a lyrical and ecstatic quality that resonates on multiple levels. However, as someone who prefers stories with strong, relatable characters and a more straightforward narrative, I found the fragmented and abstract nature of the poems to be a bit difficult to connect with. Despite this, the book's deep compassion and humane themes are commendable, and I appreciate the effort to explore profound and spiritual concepts. It's a well-written collection, but not quite what I typically enjoy.\""
