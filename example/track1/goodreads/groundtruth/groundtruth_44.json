  "review": "\"The Great Sesame Street ABC Hunt\" is a delightful and educational children's book from the iconic Sesame Street series. It cleverly incorporates the alphabet into a fun scavenger hunt, engaging young readers with vibrant illustrations and familiar characters like Big Bird and Elmo. While not as complex as some of the graphic novels I've read recently, it's a charming and effective tool for early learning, making it a valuable addition to any child's library."
