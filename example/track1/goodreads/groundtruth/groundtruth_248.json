  "review": "\"My Rotten Life\" is a delightfully quirky and humorous take on the zombie genre, tailored for a younger audience. Nathan's accidental transformation into a half-dead zombie brings a unique twist to his middle-school life, and the book balances comedy and adventure well. It's a fun and engaging read that will keep kids entertained and wanting more."
