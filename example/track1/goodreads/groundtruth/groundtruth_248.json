  "review": "\"The Ethan I Was Before\" is a moving and well-crafted middle-grade novel that resonates deeply with themes of friendship, loss, and personal growth. The characters, particularly Ethan and Coralee, are richly developed and feel authentic, which is something I highly value. The plot is engaging and filled with unexpected twists that kept me hooked. While it doesn't fit into my usual preference for children's literature with interactive elements or rhyming text, the emotional depth and the way it handles complex themes make it a standout read. It's a perfect choice for both middle-grade readers and adults looking for a heartfelt story. Highly recommended!\""
