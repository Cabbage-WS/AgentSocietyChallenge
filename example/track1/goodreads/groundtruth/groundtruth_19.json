  "review": "\"Valentine Frankenstein\" had an intriguing premise that initially piqued my interest, especially with the unique twist on a classic character. However, the execution fell short of my expectations. The transformation of Walter into \"Valentine Frankenstein\" felt abrupt and lacked coherence, making it difficult to follow the story's progression. Additionally, the book's title and cover were misleading, as they suggested a horror or thriller, which did not materialize. While the idea of a Valentine's Day prank was engaging, the overall narrative lacked the depth and clarity I look for in a book, making it a somewhat disappointing read.\""
