  "review": "\"The Kindly Ones\" is a powerful and emotionally resonant addition to the Sandman series. While it doesn't evoke the same nostalgic feelings as some of my childhood favorites, I found the depth of the characters and the masterful storytelling to be incredibly engaging. The artwork, especially the intense scenes with Lyta Hall, is visually stunning. Despite a few moments of complexity that might be overwhelming, the overall narrative is both heart-wrenching and satisfying, making it a memorable read."
