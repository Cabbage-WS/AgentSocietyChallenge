  "review": "\"The Kindly Ones\" is a compelling and emotionally charged installment in the Sandman series, delving deep into the consequences of Morpheus's actions. The artwork is stunning, complementing the dark and intricate narrative perfectly. While it can be quite heavy at times, it's a testament to Neil Gaiman's masterful storytelling and the rich mythology he has created."
