  "review": "\"If You Hopped Like A Frog\" is a delightful and educational book that perfectly aligns with my preference for children's literature that offers profound insights in a simple and engaging manner. The book's use of ratios and proportions to explain animal abilities is both clever and accessible, making it a fantastic tool for teaching math concepts to young readers. The illustrations are visually appealing and effectively support the text, enhancing the overall learning experience. While some might find the language a bit repetitive, I appreciated the book's ability to entertain and educate both children and adults. It's a must-read for anyone looking to make learning fun and interactive.\""
