  "review": "\"Actions Speak\" is a graphic novel that didn't quite hit the mark for me. While it has a solid premise and some humorous moments, the characters felt a bit flat and the story lacked the depth and emotional resonance I typically enjoy. The pacing was uneven, and I found myself less engaged than I hoped to be. The art style is clean and appealing, but the overall narrative didn't provide the catharsis or personal growth I look for in my reads. It's a light and entertaining book, but it didn't fully align with my preferences for strong character development and thematic depth."
