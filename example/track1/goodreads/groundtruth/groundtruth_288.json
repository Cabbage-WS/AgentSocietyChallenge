  "review": "\"Naperedodni Rizdva\" is a delightful children's book that resonates with the festive spirit and the magic of the holiday season. The story follows Fred, a young boy who, despite some initial challenges, finds joy and fulfillment in the gifts and surprises that come his way. The illustrations by Mariia Foia are vibrant and beautifully capture the emotional warmth of the narrative, aligning well with my preference for visually engaging books. While the plot is somewhat predictable, it still manages to evoke a sense of wonder and happiness, making it a perfect read for young children during the holidays. However, I would have appreciated a bit more depth in the storytelling, which is why I'm giving it a 4.0 instead of a 5.0. Overall, it's a charming addition to any child's holiday book collection."
