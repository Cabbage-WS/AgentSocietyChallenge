  "review": "\"The Shadow Hero\" is a delightful graphic novel that resonates well with my preferences. The blend of humor and action, along with the coming-of-age theme, kept me engaged from start to finish. The character development, especially of Hank and his mother, is strong and relatable. The artwork by Sonny Liew is stunning, adding a layer of depth to the story. While the superhero origin story has some familiar elements, the cultural and historical significance of the first Asian-American superhero makes it a unique and important read. The pacing could be a bit uneven at times, but overall, it's a highly enjoyable and insightful book."
