  "review": "\"My Book of Planets\" is a simple board book that, while engaging for very young children, does not align well with my preferences. As someone who appreciates poetry and deep, introspective themes, I found the content too basic and lacking in the emotional or intellectual depth I seek in reading material. The interactive elements, such as the holes that give clues to the next planet, are cute but not substantial enough to hold my interest. While it may serve its purpose well as a bedtime story for toddlers, it falls short of my expectations for a more nuanced and thought-provoking read."
