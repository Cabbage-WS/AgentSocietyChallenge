  "review": "\"The Journey Begins\" is a quaint and accessible read, perfect for middle-grade readers. However, as someone who has grown up with graphic novels and action-packed stories, I found the plot to be a bit basic and the character development somewhat shallow. While it's a quick and enjoyable read, it didn't quite capture the depth and excitement I've come to expect from my favorite books. It's a solid choice for younger readers or those looking for a light, nostalgic read, but it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped."
