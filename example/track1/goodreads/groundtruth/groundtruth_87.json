  "review": "\"Share, Big Bear, Share!\" is a children's picture book with a clear message about sharing and paying attention, which is commendable. However, the story's predictability and the overly didactic tone did not resonate with me. The repeated misinterpretations by Big Bear, while intended to be humorous, felt more like a gimmick and lacked the emotional depth I typically seek in a book. The illustrations, while bright, were generic and did not add much to the narrative. Overall, the book missed the mark in terms of originality and character development, making it a somewhat tedious read for me."
