  "review": "I found \"1 (Nanoka no Kare 1)\" to be a disappointing read. While the initial premise of a slow, natural progression of young love was promising, the heroine's indecisiveness and the clich\u00e9d \"love-at-first-sound\" trope quickly became frustrating. The ex-boyfriend character felt too typical and borderline crazy, which detracted from the story. The supporting characters, particularly the heroine's friends, were more focused on their own relationships, which took away from the main narrative. Although there were some adorable moments between the main characters, the overall story felt predictable and lacked the emotional depth and strong character development I typically enjoy in my reads. This book did not meet my expectations and felt more like a standard shoujo manga without much originality."
