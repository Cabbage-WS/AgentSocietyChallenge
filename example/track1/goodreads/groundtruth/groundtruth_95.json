  "review": "\"Louhi, Witch of North Farm\" is a charming and visually stunning retelling of a Finnish folktale. The poetic language and engaging storytelling effectively draw the reader into a world that is both magical and culturally rich. The illustrations are a standout feature, adding depth and beauty to the narrative. While the lack of a pronunciation guide for Finnish names is a minor drawback, it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment. This book offers a unique and educational experience that aligns well with my appreciation for richly detailed and visually engaging stories."
