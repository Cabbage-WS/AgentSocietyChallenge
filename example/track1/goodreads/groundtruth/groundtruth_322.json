  "review": "\"The Heavenly Tenants\" is a charming and whimsical story that brings the zodiac to life in a unique setting. While the concept is intriguing and the writing style is engaging, the plot feels a bit thin and the ending is somewhat abrupt. Nevertheless, it's a delightful read for those who enjoy gentle fantasy and a touch of humor."
