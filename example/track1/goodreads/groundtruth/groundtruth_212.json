  "review": "\"Big Magic for Little Hands\" is a charming book that seems to hit the mark with its intended audience, as evidenced by the positive response from a middle school magic club. The retro look and clear, user-friendly instructions are definite pluses. However, with my limited reading history, I find it hard to fully connect with the book's themes and style. While it's a good introduction to magic for young readers, it doesn't stand out in a way that would make it a personal favorite. The lack of depth in the content and the focus on basic tricks might not be as engaging for more experienced or older readers. Still, it's a solid choice for those looking to spark an interest in magic in younger children.\""
