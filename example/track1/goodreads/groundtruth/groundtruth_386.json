  "review": "\"Panicle\" didn't quite align with my usual reading preferences. While the poetry is undoubtedly well-crafted and the imagery is vivid, I typically enjoy more narrative-driven works, such as children's literature with adventure and fantasy elements or graphic novels with superhero themes. The dense and sometimes complex nature of the poems required more engagement than I was looking for, and the lack of a clear, linear story made it hard for me to connect on a deeper level. The art-integrated section was intriguing but also felt a bit out of my comfort zone. Overall, while I appreciate the artistic merit, it wasn't the type of book that resonated with me."
