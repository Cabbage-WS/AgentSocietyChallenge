  "review": "\"The Future of Memory\" by Bob Perelman is a compelling blend of wit and profundity that resonates deeply with my interest in thematic depth and character studies. Perelman's poetry, as both witty and unsettling, offers a unique perspective on the human condition, particularly in how language and memory intersect. The absence of dense theoretical jargon, which often plagues non-fiction, is refreshing. While the book leans heavily into the abstract, it maintains a grounded, relatable quality that makes it an engaging read. The poem's structure and the way it deconstructs traditional forms of expression align well with my appreciation for innovative and thought-provoking literature. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a mix of humor and existential reflection."
