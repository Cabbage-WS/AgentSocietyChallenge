  "review": "\"Ep\u00e4varmoina aikoina\" did not resonate with my usual preferences. While I enjoy a mix of suspense and beauty, this installment felt disjointed and lacked the cohesive atmosphere I appreciate. The reintroduction of characters seemed superficial, and the plot elements, like the gods of Hypsis, added little to the narrative. It's a far cry from the engaging and ethereal stories I love, making it a disappointing read in the series."
