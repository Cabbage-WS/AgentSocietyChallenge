  "review": "\"Daisy's Big Night\" is a delightful addition to the series, perfect for early readers who are just beginning to explore the world of chapter books. The character of Daisy is endearing and relatable, with her love for words and poetry shining through. The book does a fantastic job of introducing various forms of poetry in an engaging and accessible way, which I found both educational and entertaining. The illustrations are charming and complement the text well, helping to bring Daisy's world to life. While the writing style is simple, it is appropriate for its target audience and effectively conveys the story. Overall, I highly recommend this book for young readers and anyone looking to foster a love of language and creativity.\""
