  "review": "\"The Poet Assassinated\" by Guillaume Apollinaire is a unique and surreal novella that offers a fascinating glimpse into the early 20th-century avant-garde. The fragmented and dream-like narrative, with its one-word chapter titles, is both innovative and thought-provoking. However, the book's dense and complex structure, while historically significant, sometimes makes it difficult to engage with on an emotional level. The lack of a more developed plot and the occasional obscure references detract from the overall reading experience. While I appreciate its historical and cultural significance, it didn't quite resonate with me as much as I had hoped."
