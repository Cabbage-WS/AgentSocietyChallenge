  "review": "\"Cages\" is a visually stunning and emotionally profound graphic novel that resonates deeply with my appreciation for quirky and unique storylines. The art is breathtaking, with a style that is both raw and sophisticated, reminiscent of Egon Schiele's work. The narrative, while complex and challenging, is a rich tapestry of interconnected stories that explore themes of art, inspiration, and human connection. While the book's intensity and depth require a more attentive and slower reading pace, it left a lasting impression and is a testament to Dave McKean's artistic genius."
