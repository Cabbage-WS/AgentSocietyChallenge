  "review": "\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Vol. 4\" offers a visually stunning and action-packed narrative that aligns with my appreciation for well-developed story elements and engaging characters. However, while the artwork by Andy Seto is indeed glorious and the kung fu action sequences are thrilling, the plot and character development do not resonate as deeply with me as the coming-of-age stories and biographies I typically enjoy. The book is a satisfying read, but it doesn't quite hit the emotional or thematic notes that I find most compelling."
