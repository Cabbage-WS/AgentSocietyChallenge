  "review": "\"Gone-Away Lake\" is a charming and nostalgic read, but it didn't quite hit the mark for me. While the setting of a forgotten lakeside village is unique and the characters of Portia and Julian are engaging, the story felt a bit too simple and lacked the depth and complexity I usually enjoy in my reads. The themes of discovery and friendship are well-executed, but the plot didn't offer the same level of intrigue or character development I've come to expect from my favorite books. It's a pleasant and easy summer read, but it didn't leave a lasting impact."
