  "review": "\"Comic Party, Vol. 02\" offers an engaging look into the world of conventions and doujinshi artists, which is a unique and interesting premise. The main character's journey to improve his skills and form meaningful connections is well-developed, aligning with my appreciation for character growth. However, the series feels incomplete without the final volume, leaving some plot points unresolved and creating a sense of frustration. While the humor and camaraderie among the characters are enjoyable, the pacing could be tighter, and the story could benefit from a bit more tension and higher stakes. Overall, it's a solid read, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of my favorite books."
