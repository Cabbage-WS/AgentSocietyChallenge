  "review": "\"5,000 km Per Second\" is a visually stunning graphic novel that captures the essence of a bittersweet love story through its vivid watercolor illustrations. The narrative, while fragmented and sometimes indirect, effectively conveys the emotional depth and complexity of Piero and Lucia's relationship. Although it might not be as straightforward as some might prefer, it's a beautiful and poignant read that resonates long after the last page is turned."
