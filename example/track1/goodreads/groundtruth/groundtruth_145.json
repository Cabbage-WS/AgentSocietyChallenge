  "review": "\"The Secret Garden\" is a treasure, resonating deeply with my love for classic children's literature that offers rich, layered meaning for both young and old. The story of Mary Lennox's transformation and the revival of the hidden garden is beautifully woven, with a timeless charm that stands the test of re-reading. Despite a few moments of slower pacing, the book's heartwarming and kind-hearted nature, along with its profound reflections on growth and the power of nature, make it a truly delightful and impactful read. The illustrations in this edition add an extra layer of magic, enhancing the overall experience."
