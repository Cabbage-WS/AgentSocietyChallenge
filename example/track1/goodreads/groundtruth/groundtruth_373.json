  "review": "I found \"A.I. Love You, Vol. 05\" to be a decent read, with engaging artwork and a plot that continues to develop the relationship between the characters. However, the pacing felt a bit slow at times, and the storyline didn't offer as many surprises as I had hoped. Still, it's a solid addition to the series for fans of manga and sci-fi romance."
