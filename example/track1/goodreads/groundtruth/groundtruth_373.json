  "review": "\"Literally Me\" by Julie Houts is a unique blend of illustrated essays that offer a satirical take on modern female identity. While the charming and often humorous drawings resonated with me, the book's focus on the social media era and the pressures of being a \"Girlboss\" didn't fully align with my usual preferences for deeper, more introspective poetry and literature. The pieces, such as 'The Four Horsewomen of the Apocalypse' and the journal from the perspective of 'Tree,' were particularly engaging, but the overall content felt a bit too light and pop-culture-centric. It's a fun read, but I found myself yearning for more profound insights and personal connections. Still, Houts's unique style and wit make it a worthwhile addition to the genre."
