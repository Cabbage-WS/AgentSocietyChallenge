  "review": "\"Mountains and Rivers Without End\" by Gary Snyder is a collection of poems that, while beautifully crafted, lacks the emotional depth and personal connection I often crave in poetry. The endless lists of natural elements, while detailed, felt more like a catalog than an engaging narrative. The Zen Buddhist themes, which I have little interest in, further distanced me from the material. While there were a few interesting autobiographical elements that provided a glimpse into Snyder's life, they weren't enough to redeem the overall experience. This book didn't align with my preferences for diverse and inclusive storytelling or the personal and cultural explorations I enjoy in memoirs and comics."
