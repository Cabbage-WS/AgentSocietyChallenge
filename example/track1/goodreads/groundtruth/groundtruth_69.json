  "review": "\"Charlotte\" offers an engaging premise with children possessing superpowers, which piqued my interest. However, the main character, Yuu Otosaka, comes across as overly narcissistic and uses his abilities for personal gain, which I found off-putting and lacking in depth. The story's direction is uncertain, and while there are some interesting moments, the character development and sincerity in growth are lacking, making it a somewhat unsatisfying read."
