  "review": "\"A Gift for Abuelita\" is a poignant and beautifully illustrated book that captures the essence of the Day of the Dead traditions. The story of Rosita and her family's journey through loss and remembrance is both touching and educational. The mixed media collages by Robert Chapman are visually stunning, adding depth and emotion to the narrative. While some may find the Spanish vocabulary challenging, the bilingual format is a valuable addition for those looking to explore cultural literacy. The book's blend of cultural insight and emotional depth makes it a worthy read for both children and adults, though the content density might be a bit much for very young readers. Overall, it's a heartfelt and enriching experience.\""
