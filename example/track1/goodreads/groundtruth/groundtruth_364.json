  "review": "\"The Incal\" by Moebius and Jodorowsky is a visually stunning graphic novel with a complex and ambitious plot. However, it didn't resonate with me as much as I hoped. The humor is often too surreal and adult-oriented, which doesn't align with my preference for light, child-friendly humor. Additionally, the pacing felt uneven, and the story was sometimes hard to follow, which made it difficult to engage with the characters. While the artwork is undoubtedly impressive, the overall experience fell short of my expectations."
