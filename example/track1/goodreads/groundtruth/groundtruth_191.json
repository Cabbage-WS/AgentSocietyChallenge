  "review": "\"Inkspell\" is a book that offers a rich and imaginative world, which is a definite plus for a reader who enjoys engaging and well-received stories. However, the narrative's length and some of the structural issues mentioned by other reviewers are a bit off-putting. While the concept of characters coming to life from a book is fascinating, the execution sometimes feels a bit clunky. The story has moments of genuine charm and creativity, particularly in its exploration of the magical inkscape, but it could have benefited from tighter editing. Despite these flaws, it's a book that children and young adults might find captivating, even if it doesn't fully resonate with adult readers."
