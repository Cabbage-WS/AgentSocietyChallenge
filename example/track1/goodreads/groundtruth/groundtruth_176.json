  "review": "\"Miss Rumphius\" is a heartwarming story that beautifully encapsulates the importance of leaving the world a little better than we found it. Alice Rumphius's journey, from her travels around the world to her simple act of spreading beauty through lupines, is both inspiring and profoundly moving. Barbara Cooney's illustrations are a perfect complement to the narrative, making this book a timeless treasure for all ages."
