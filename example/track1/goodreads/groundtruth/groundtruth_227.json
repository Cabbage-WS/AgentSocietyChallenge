  "review": "\"King Me\" is a powerful and evocative collection of poetry that resonates with its rich language and thoughtful exploration of personal and public themes. The book's deep engagement with the mythology of kings and the tragic realities of young black men in America is both heartbreaking and enlightening. While the repetitions in some poems were a bit hit or miss, the overall impact is profound and moving. The book\u2019s blend of historical and contemporary narratives, such as the poignant reference to Emmett Till, makes it a significant and necessary read. Although it doesn't align perfectly with my usual preference for fantastical children's literature, the beauty and depth of the poetry are undeniable."
