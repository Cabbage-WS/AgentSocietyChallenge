  "review": "\"1 [Tora to Okami] offers an interesting blend of BL romance and a slice-of-life story about saving a family restaurant. The characters are engaging, especially the contrast between Tora and Ookami, which adds a dynamic to the narrative. However, the plot can feel a bit slow at times, and the BL elements might not appeal to everyone. Still, it's a decent read for fans of the genre.\""
