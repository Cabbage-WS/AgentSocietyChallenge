  "review": "\"Die Frau ist frei geboren - Olympe de Gouges\" is a compelling graphic novel that aligns well with my interest in political and biographical narratives. The artwork is detailed and enhances the storytelling, making Olympe de Gouges's life and activism come alive. The pacing is steady, and the historical context is well-integrated, providing a rich understanding of her impact. However, while the book is engaging, it doesn't quite reach the level of innovation and depth I typically look for in a 5-star read. Still, it's a valuable and enlightening addition to any collection on feminist history."
