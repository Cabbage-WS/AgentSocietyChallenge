  "review": "\"The Heavenly Tenants\" is an intriguing concept, blending fantasy and humor with the personified zodiac signs taking care of a farm. However, the execution falls short, particularly in character development and plot depth. The story is too brief to fully explore its unique premise, and the characters, while whimsical, lack the emotional depth I appreciate in my reads. The illustrations are a highlight, but they can't compensate for the underdeveloped narrative. It's a charming yet unsatisfying read that leaves much to be desired."
