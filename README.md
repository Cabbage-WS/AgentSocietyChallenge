Welcome to the **WWW'25 AgentSociety Challenge**! This repository provides the tools and framework needed to participate in a competition that focuses on building **LLM Agents** for **user behavior simulation** and **recommendation systems** based on the Yelp dataset.

Participants are tasked with developing intelligent agents that interact with a simulated environment and perform specific tasks in two competition tracks:
1. **User Behavior Simulation Track**: Agents simulate user behavior, including generating reviews and ratings.
2. **Recommendation Track**: Agents generate recommendations based on provided contextual data.

This repository includes:
- The core library `yelpsimulator` for environment simulation.
- Scripts for dataset processing and analysis.
- Example usage for creating and evaluating agents.

---

## Directory Structure

### 1. **`yelpsimulator/`**  
This is the core library containing all source code required for the competition.

- **`agents/`**: Contains base agent classes (`SimulationAgent`, `RecommendationAgent`) and their abstractions. Participants must extend these classes for their implementations.
- **`scenarios/`**: Defines scenario structures for each track (`SimulationScenario`, `RecommendationScenario`).
- **`tools/`**: Includes utility tools:
  - `InteractionTool`: A utility for interacting with the Yelp dataset during simulations.
  - `EvaluationTool`: Provides comprehensive metrics for both recommendation (HR@1/3/5) and simulation tasks (RMSE, sentiment analysis).
- **`simulator.py`**: The main simulation framework, which handles scenario evaluation and agent execution.

### 2. **`data_images/`**  
Contains analysis images and graphs for the raw Yelp dataset. These visualizations provide insights into the dataset structure and characteristics.

### 3. **`example/`**  
Contains usage examples of the `yelpsimulator` library. Includes sample agents and scripts to demonstrate how to load scenarios, set agents, and evaluate them.

### 4. **`yelp_data_process.py`**  
A script to process the raw Yelp dataset into the required format for use with the `yelpsimulator` library. This script ensures the dataset is cleaned and structured correctly for simulations.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Library

The repository is organized using [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Follow these steps to install the library:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yelpsimulator.git
   cd yelpsimulator
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

---

### 2. Download the Dataset

#### Option One: Process the Raw Yelp Dataset
1. Download the raw Yelp dataset from the [Yelp Dataset Challenge page](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
2. Run the `yelp_data_process.py` script to process the dataset:
   ```bash
   python yelp_data_process.py --input <path_to_raw_dataset> --output <path_to_processed_dataset>
   ```

#### Option Two: Use a Preprocessed Dataset
1. Download the preprocessed dataset from [TBD]().
2. Unzip the dataset into your working directory.

---

### 3. Organize Your Data

Ensure the dataset is organized in a directory structure similar to this:

```
<your_dataset_directory>/
â”œâ”€â”€ business.json
â”œâ”€â”€ review.json
â”œâ”€â”€ user.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tip.json
â””â”€â”€ checkin.json
```

You can name the dataset directory whatever you prefer (e.g., `dataset/`).

---

### 4. Develop Your Agent

Create a custom agent by extending either `SimulationAgent` or `RecommendationAgent`. Refer to the examples in the `example/` directory. Here's a quick template:

```python
from yelpsimulator.agents.simulation_agent import SimulationAgent

class MySimulationAgent(SimulationAgent):
    def forward(self):
        # Implement your logic here
        star = 4.0
        review_text = "Great experience!"
        behavior_metrics = (10, 2, 1)
        return star, review_text, behavior_metrics
```

---

### 5. Run the Evaluation Script

Run the simulation using the provided `Simulator` class:

```python
from yelpsimulator import Simulator
from my_agent import MySimulationAgent

# Initialize Simulator
simulator = Simulator(data_dir="path/to/your/dataset")

# Load scenarios
simulator.set_scenario(scenario_dir="path/to/scenario_directory")

# Set your custom agent
simulator.set_agent(MySimulationAgent)

# Run evaluation
results = simulator.run_simulation()

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

## Introduction to the `InteractionTool`

The `InteractionTool` is the core utility for interacting with the Yelp dataset. It provides an interface for querying user, business, review, tip, and check-in data within the context of a scenario.

### Idea

The `InteractionTool` acts as a middleware between the agent and the environment. It ensures agents only access the data relevant to the current scenario and within the specified constraints (e.g., time limits).

### Functions

- **Get User Information**:
  Retrieve user data by user ID or current scenario context.
  ```python
  user_info = interaction_tool.get_user(user_id="example_user_id")
  ```

- **Get Business Information**:
  Retrieve business data by business ID or current scenario context.
  ```python
  business_info = interaction_tool.get_business(business_id="example_business_id")
  ```

- **Get Reviews**:
  Fetch reviews related to a specific business or user, filtered by time.
  ```python
  reviews = interaction_tool.get_reviews(business_id="example_business_id")
  ```

- **Get Tips**:
  Fetch tips related to a specific business or user, filtered by time.
  ```python
  tips = interaction_tool.get_tips(business_id="example_business_id")
  ```

- **Get Check-ins**:
  Fetch check-in data related to a specific business, filtered by time.
  ```python
  checkins = interaction_tool.get_checkins(business_id="example_business_id")
  ```
